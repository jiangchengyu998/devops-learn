00:09	Katara: WATER...
00:11	EARTH...
00:13	FIRE...
00:15	AIR.
00:17	LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.
00:22	THEN, EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.
00:26	ONLY THE AVATAR, MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,
00:29	COULD STOP THEM.
00:30	BUT WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED HIM MOST,
00:32	HE VANISHED.
00:33	100 YEARS PASSED,
00:35	AND MY BROTHER AND I DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR--
00:38	AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG.
00:39	AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING SKILLS ARE GREAT,
00:41	HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN BEFORE HE'S READY TO SAVE ANYONE.
00:44	Aang: OOF!
00:46	BUT I BELIEVE AANG CAN SAVE THE WORLD.
00:57	Aang: YOU'RE WATERBENDER!
00:59	WELL, NOT YET.
01:01	IF WE GO TO THE NORTH POLE,
01:02	YOU CAN MASTER WATERBENDING.
01:04	WE CAN LEARN IT TOGETHER.
01:06	I LOST MY MOTHER IN A FIRE NATION RAID.
01:09	THIS NECKLACE IS ALL I HAVE LEFT OF HER.
01:14	Roku: AANG, YOU MUST DEFEAT THE FIRE LORD
01:18	BEFORE THE COMET ARRIVES.
01:20	BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED LEARNING WATERBENDING,
01:23	NOT TO MENTION EARTH AND FIRE.
01:25	MASTERING THE ELEMENTS TAKES YEARS OF DISCIPLINE AND PRACTICE,
01:29	BUT IF THE WORLD IS TO SURVIVE,
01:31	YOU MUST DO IT BY SUMMER'S END.
01:47	[PANTING]
01:50	Sokka: WOULD YOU SIT DOWN?!
01:52	IF WE HIT A BUMP, YOU'LL GO FLYING OFF!
01:54	WHAT'S BUGGING YOU ANYWAY?
01:56	IT'S WHAT AVATAR ROKU SAID.
01:57	I'M SUPPOSED TO MASTER ALL 4 ELEMENTS
01:59	BEFORE THAT COMET ARRIVES.
02:01	WELL, LET'S SEE.
02:03	YOU PRETTY MUCH MASTERED AIRBENDING,
02:04	AND THAT ONLY TOOK YOU 112 YEARS.
02:06	I'M SURE YOU CAN MASTER
02:07	3 MORE ELEMENTS BY NEXT SUMMER.
02:09	I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED WATERBENDING,
02:11	AND WE'RE STILL WEEKS AWAY FROM THE NORTH POLE.
02:13	WHAT AM I GONNA DO?!
02:14	CALM DOWN.
02:16	IT'S GONNA BE OK.
02:17	IF YOU WANT,
02:19	I CAN TRY AND TEACH YOU
02:20	SOME OF THE STUFF I KNOW.
02:21	YOU'D DO THAT?
02:22	WE'LL NEED TO FIND
02:24	A GOOD SOURCE OF WATER FIRST.
02:26	MAYBE WE CAN FIND A PUDDLE FOR YOU TO SPLASH IN.
02:30	NICE PUDDLE.
02:34	[SNORTING]
02:39	[SCREECHES]
02:42	Aang: YEAH!
02:44	DON'T START WITHOUT ME, BOY!
02:45	REMEMBER THE REASON WE'RE HERE.
02:47	OH, RIGHT.
02:48	TIME TO PRACTICE WATERBENDING.
02:50	GREAT. SO, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
02:52	YOU COULD CLEAN THE GUNK
02:54	OUT OF APPA'S TOES.
02:56	SO, WHILE YOU GUYS ARE PLAYING IN THE WATER,
02:58	I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HARD AT WORK
03:00	PICKING MUD OUT OF A GIANT BISON'S FEET?
03:02	MUD AND BUGS.
03:05	OK.
03:12	[GRUNTING]
03:15	WHOA! WHOA!
03:17	OOF!
03:18	SOMEONE'S CHANGING OUR COURSE.
03:22	WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS MUTINY?
03:23	NO ONE TOLD YOU TO CHANGE COURSE.
03:25	ACTUALLY, SOMEONE DID.
03:27	I ASSURE YOU,
03:29	IT IS A MATTER OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE,
03:31	PRINCE ZUKO.
03:33	IS IT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE AVATAR?
03:34	EVEN MORE URGENT.
03:36	IT SEEMS I--
03:37	I'VE LOST MY LOTUS TILE.
03:40	LOTUS TILE?
03:42	FOR MY PAI GOW GAME.
03:44	MOST PEOPLE THINK THE LOTUS TILE
03:46	INSIGNIFICANT.
03:48	BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE UNUSUAL STRATEGY
03:51	THAT I EMPLOY.
03:53	YOU'VE CHANGED OUR COURSE FOR A STUPID LOTUS TILE?
03:56	SEE, YOU, LIKE MOST PEOPLE,
03:58	UNDERESTIMATE ITS VALUE.
04:00	JUST GIVE ME 10 MINUTES TO CHECK THE MERCHANTS
04:02	AT THIS PORT OF CALL.
04:04	HOPEFULLY, THEY'LL HAVE THE LOTUS TILE IN STOCK
04:07	AND I CAN GET ON WITH MY LIFE.
04:10	[BREATHING DEEPLY]
04:12	I'M LUCKY TO HAVE SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING NEPHEW.
04:18	[SIGHS]
04:19	YEAH, DON'T GET TOO HAPPY.
04:20	YOU'VE GOT TO DO ME NEXT.
04:21	[SIGHS]
04:23	THIS IS A PRETTY BASIC MOVE,
04:25	BUT IT STILL TOOK ME MONTHS TO PERFECT.
04:27	SO, DON'T BE FRUSTRATED
04:29	IF YOU DON'T GET IT RIGHT AWAY.
04:31	JUST PUSH AND PULL THE WATER LIKE THIS.
04:34	THE KEY IS GETTING THE WRIST MOVEMENT RIGHT.
04:37	LIKE THIS?
04:41	THAT'S ALMOST RIGHT.
04:43	IF YOU KEEP PRACTICING,
04:44	I'M SURE EVENTUALLY--
04:46	HEY, I'M BENDING IT ALREADY!
04:48	WOW! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT THAT SO QUICKLY.
04:50	IT TOOK ME TWO MONTHS TO LEARN THAT MOVE.
04:52	WELL, YOU HAD TO FIGURE IT OUT
04:54	ALL ON YOUR OWN.
04:55	I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A GREAT TEACHER.
04:57	THANKS.
04:58	SO, WHAT'S NEXT?
05:00	THIS IS A MORE DIFFICULT MOVE.
05:01	I CALL IT STREAMING THE WATER.
05:07	IT'S HARDER THAN IT LOOKS,
05:08	SO DON'T BE DISAPPOINTED IF...
05:20	NICE WORK.
05:21	THOUGH THE OVER-THE-HEAD FLAIR WAS UNNECESSARY.
05:24	SORRY.
05:25	WELL, DON'T STOP NOW.
05:26	KEEP 'EM COMING.
05:28	WELL, I KIND OF KNOW THIS ONE OTHER MOVE,
05:30	BUT IT'S PRETTY HARD.
05:32	I HAVEN'T EVEN TOTALLY FIGURED IT OUT YET.
05:33	THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A BIG, POWERFUL WAVE.
05:41	[GRUNTS]
05:42	SO, LIKE THIS?
05:48	AANG!
05:58	LOOKS LIKE I GOT THE HANG OF THAT MOVE.
05:59	WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?
06:01	THAT'S ENOUGH PRACTICING FOR TODAY.
06:03	YEAH, I'LL SAY!
06:04	YOU JUST PRACTICED OUR SUPPLIES
06:06	DOWN THE RIVER.
06:07	UH, SORRY.
06:09	I'M SURE WE CAN FIND SOME WAY
06:11	TO REPLACE ALL THIS STUFF.
06:12	MY LIFE WAS HARD ENOUGH
06:14	WHEN YOU WERE JUST AN AIRBENDER.
06:22	[PEOPLE CHATTERING]
06:25	Man: PLEASE, PUT ME DOWN!
06:27	Vender: SEE THE WONDER IN THIS BAG!
06:29	WHO'S BRAVE ENOUGH TO LOOK INTO THIS BAG?!
06:32	WOW!
06:36	WE'VE GOT EXACTLY 3 COPPER PIECES LEFT
06:38	FROM THE MONEY THAT KING BUMI GAVE US.
06:40	LET'S SPEND IT WISELY.
06:41	UH, MAKE THAT TWO COPPER PIECES, SOKKA.
06:44	I COULDN'T SAY NO TO THIS WHISTLE.
06:47	[AIR HISSES]
06:50	IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK.
06:51	[SQUEALS]
06:53	SEE? EVEN MOMO THINKS IT'S A PIECE OF JUNK.
06:56	NO OFFENSE, AANG,
06:58	BUT I'LL HOLD THE MONEY FROM NOW ON.
07:05	Man: EARTH NATION! FIRE NATION!
07:07	WATER NATION.
07:09	SO LONG AS BARGAINS ARE YOUR INCLINATION,
07:11	YOU'RE WELCOME HERE!
07:13	DON'T BE SHY.
07:14	COME ON BY!
07:16	OH, YOU THERE!
07:17	I CAN SEE FROM YOUR CLOTHING
07:20	THAT YOU'RE WORLD TRAVELING TYPES.
07:22	PERHAPS I CAN INTEREST YOU
07:23	IN SOME EXOTIC CURIOS?
07:25	SURE!
07:27	WHAT ARE CURIOS?
07:30	I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE,
07:32	BUT WE GOT 'EM.
07:38	[GASPS]
07:39	HUH?
07:49	Man: I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A FINE SPECIMEN OF LEMUR.
07:54	THAT BEAST WOULD FETCH ME A HEFTY SUM
07:56	IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN BARTERING.
07:58	[SQUAWKS]
08:00	[HISSES]
08:02	MOMO'S NOT FOR SALE.
08:12	LOOK AT THIS, AANG!
08:13	IT'S A WATERBENDING SCROLL.
08:16	CHECK OUT THESE CRAZY MOVES.
08:18	WHERE DID YOU GET A WATERBENDING SCROLL?
08:21	LET'S JUST SAY I GOT IT UP NORTH
08:24	AT A MOST REASONABLE PRICE--
08:26	FREE.
08:30	WAIT A MINUTE.
08:31	SEA-LOVING TRADERS
08:33	WITH SUSPICIOUSLY ACQUIRED MERCHANDISE
08:36	AND PET REPTILE BIRDS?
08:39	YOU GUYS ARE PIRATES!
08:41	WE PREFER TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS
08:43	HIGH-RISK TRADERS.
08:46	SO, HOW MUCH FOR THE TRADED SCROLL?
08:49	I'VE ALREADY GOT A BUYER--
08:50	A NOBLEMAN IN THE EARTH KINGDOM--
08:52	UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU KIDS HAVE
08:55	200 GOLD PIECES ON YOU RIGHT NOW.
08:58	I KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE GUYS, KATARA.
09:00	PIRATES LOVE TO HAGGLE.
09:03	WATCH AND LEARN.
09:06	WHAT SAY YE TO THE PRICE OF...
09:08	ONE COPPER PIECE?
09:11	HA HA HA HA!
09:13	THE PRICE IS 200 GOLD PIECES.
09:16	I DON'T HAGGLE ON ITEMS THIS RARE.
09:18	OK, TWO COPPER PIECES.
09:21	IT'S NOT AS AMUSING THE SECOND TIME, BOY.
09:24	AANG, CAN WE GET OUT OF HERE?
09:26	I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING WEIRD LOOKS.
09:28	AYE! WE BE CASTING OFF NOW!
09:31	WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT, KATARA?
09:33	YEAH, I WAS JUST STARTING TO BROWSE THROUGH
09:35	THEIR BOOMERANG COLLECTION.
09:36	I'LL JUST FEEL A LOT BETTER
09:38	ONCE WE GET AWAY FROM HERE.
09:39	HEY, YOU!
09:40	GET BACK HERE!
09:42	WELL, WELL.
09:43	LOOK WHO'S COME TO THEIR SENSES.
09:45	TOLD YOU THE HAGGLING WOULD PAY OFF.
09:46	[GROWLING]
09:58	THERE THEY ARE!
09:59	GET 'EM!
10:00	NOBODY'S GOING NOWHERE!
10:02	[LAUGHING]
10:05	I DON'T THINK THESE PIRATES
10:07	ARE HERE TO TRADE WITH US.
10:08	GET BACK HERE!
10:10	YOU LITTLE--
10:12	COME ON!
10:13	THIS WAY.
10:14	LET'S CUT 'EM OFF!
10:17	WHOA!
10:21	WHOA!
10:22	OOF!
10:28	OH! OH!
10:30	OH! OH!
10:36	[SCREAMING]
10:37	MY CABBAGES!
10:38	THIS PLACE IS WORSE THAN OMASHU!
10:41	[GROANING]
10:47	AHA!
10:49	[SHUDDERS]
10:51	I HOPE THAT LEMUR OF YOURS
10:53	HAS 9 LIVES.
10:56	NOW, WHO GETS TO TASTE
10:59	THE STEEL OF MY BLADE FIRST?
11:01	NO, THANKS.
11:03	HAA!
11:05	[SCREAMS]
11:06	GRAB ON TIGHT!
11:08	AANG, I THOUGHT WE WERE
11:09	RUNNING AWAY FROM THE PIRATES.
11:11	JUST HANG ON.
11:12	Both: WHOA!
11:14	OW!
11:16	WHOA!
11:20	I USED TO KIND OF LOOK UP TO PIRATES,
11:22	BUT THOSE GUYS ARE TERRIBLE.
11:24	I KNOW.
11:25	THAT'S WHY I TOOK THIS.
11:27	NO WAY!
11:28	ISN'T IT GREAT?!
11:30	NO WONDER THEY WERE TRYING TO HACK US UP.
11:32	YOU STOLE THEIR WATERBENDING SCROLL.
11:34	I PREFER TO THINK OF IT AS
11:36	HIGH-RISK TRADING.
11:37	HA HA HA.
11:39	GOOD ONE, KATARA.
11:40	SOKKA, WHERE TO YOU THINK THEY GOT IT?
11:42	THEY STOLE IT FROM A WATERBENDER.
11:45	IT DOESN'T MATTER.
11:46	YOU PUT ALL OF OUR LIVES IN DANGER
11:48	JUST SO YOU COULD LEARN
11:49	SOME STUPID, FANCY SPLASHES.
11:51	THESE ARE REAL WATERBENDING FORMS.
11:54	YOU KNOW HOW CRUCIAL IT IS
11:55	FOR AANG TO LEARN WATERBENDING.
11:56	[SIGHS]
11:58	WHATEVER.
11:59	WELL, WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.
12:01	WE HAVE IT.
12:02	WE MIGHT AS WELL LEARN FROM IT.
12:12	I'VE CHECKED ALL THE SHOPS ON THIS PIER.
12:15	NOT A LOTUS TILE IN THE ENTIRE MARKETPLACE.
12:19	IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THIS TRIP
12:20	WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME
12:22	FOR EVERYONE!
12:23	QUITE THE CONTRARY.
12:24	I ALWAYS SAY THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN
12:27	FINDING SOMETHING YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
12:29	IS FINDING SOMETHING YOU WEREN'T LOOKING FOR
12:32	AT A GREAT BARGAIN.
12:36	YOU BOUGHT A SUNGI HORN?
12:37	FOR MUSIC NIGHT ON THE SHIP.
12:39	NOW, IF WE ONLY HAD SOME WOODWINDS.
12:44	OH, THIS PLACE LOOKS PROMISING.
12:47	OH, THAT IS HANDSOME!
12:50	WOULDN'T IT LOOK MAGNIFICENT IN THE GALLEY?
12:52	WE LOST THE WATER TRIBE GIRL
12:54	AND THE LITTLE BALD MONK
12:55	SHE WAS TRAVELING WITH.
12:57	THIS MONK, DID HE HAVE AN ARROW ON HIS HEAD?
12:59	[IMITATES MONKEY]
13:01	I JUST WANT TO TRY THIS ONE MOVE FIRST,
13:03	AND THEN IT'S ALL YOURS.
13:04	HERE, HOLD IT OPEN FOR ME.
13:09	THE SINGLE WATER WHIP.
13:11	LOOKS DOABLE.
13:17	OW!
13:18	HA HA HA!
13:19	WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
13:21	I'M SORRY, BUT YOU DESERVED THAT.
13:22	YOU'VE BEEN DUPED.
13:24	SHE'S ONLY INTERESTED IN TEACHING HERSELF.
13:26	AANG WILL GET HIS TURN
13:27	ONCE I FIGURE OUT THE WATER WHIP.
13:32	[SCREECHES]
13:33	UGH! WHY CAN'T I GET THIS STUPID MOVE?!
13:36	YOU'LL GET IT.
13:39	YOU'VE JUST GOTTA SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT
13:41	THROUGH THE STANCES.
13:42	THERE. SEE?
13:44	THE KEY TO BENDING IS--
13:45	WILL YOU PLEASE SHUT YOUR AIR HOLE!
13:47	BELIEVE IT OR NOT, YOUR INFINITE WISDOM
13:49	GETS A LITTLE OLD SOMETIMES!
13:51	WHY DON'T WE JUST THROW THE SCROLL AWAY
13:52	SINCE YOU'RE SO NATURALLY GIFTED?!
13:56	WHAT?!
14:00	OH, MY GOSH, AANG.
14:02	I AM SO SORRY.
14:05	I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.
14:06	BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
14:08	IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
14:09	HERE, THIS IS YOURS.
14:11	I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
14:12	ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT ANYMORE.
14:14	IT'S OK, KATARA.
14:15	WHAT ABOUT MOMO?
14:16	HE'S THE REAL VICTIM HERE.
14:18	I'M SORRY, MOMO.
14:19	AND WHAT ABOUT ME?
14:21	THERE WAS THAT TIME YOU--
14:22	NO MORE APOLOGIES.
14:34	SHOULDN'T WE STOP TO SEARCH THE WOODS?
14:36	WE DON'T NEED TO STOP.
14:38	THEY STOLE A WATERBENDING SCROLL, RIGHT?
14:40	MM-HMM.
14:41	THEN THEY'LL BE ON THE WATER.
15:00	[PURRS]
15:03	SHH.
15:05	MOMO, GO BACK TO SLEEP.
15:08	[COOS]
15:09	SHH!
15:18	[GRUNTING]
15:21	SHOOT!
15:23	COME ON, WATER! WORK WITH ME HERE!
15:25	OK, WHAT IF I--OW!
15:27	[DISTANT YELLING]
15:30	OK, KATARA,
15:31	SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT THROUGH THE STANCES.
15:33	UGH!
15:34	[SCRAPING]
15:38	[GASPS]
15:41	AH! NO!
15:42	LET GO OF ME!
15:44	[GRUNTS]
15:46	I'LL SAVE YOU FROM THE PIRATES.
15:56	TELL ME WHERE HE IS,
15:57	AND I WON'T HURT YOU OR YOUR BROTHER.
15:58	GO JUMP IN THE RIVER!
16:01	TRY TO UNDERSTAND,
16:03	I NEED TO CAPTURE HIM
16:04	TO RESTORE SOMETHING I'VE LOST--
16:06	MY HONOR.
16:07	PERHAPS IN EXCHANGE,
16:09	I CAN RESTORE SOMETHING YOU'VE LOST.
16:13	MY MOTHER'S NECKLACE.
16:15	HOW DID YOU GET THAT?!
16:16	I DIDN'T STEAL IT
16:18	IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE WONDERING.
16:19	TELL ME WHERE HE IS.
16:21	NO!
16:23	ENOUGH OF THIS NECKLACE GARBAGE.
16:24	YOU PROMISED THE SCROLL.
16:26	I WONDER HOW MUCH MONEY THIS IS WORTH.
16:29	[GASPS]
16:29	NO!
16:31	A LOT, APPARENTLY.
16:33	NOW, YOU HELP ME FIND WHAT I WANT,
16:35	YOU'LL GET THIS BACK,
16:36	AND EVERYONE GOES HOME HAPPY.
16:38	SEARCH THE WOODS FOR THE BOY AND MEET BACK HERE.
16:40	FINE.
16:45	[GROANING]
16:47	HUH?
16:48	WHERE DID SHE GO?
16:49	I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
16:50	[YAWNS]
16:52	WHAT'S WRONG?
16:53	SHE TOOK THE SCROLL.
16:54	SHE'S OBSESSED WITH THAT THING.
16:56	IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
16:57	BEFORE SHE GETS US ALL IN DEEP--
16:58	WHOA!
17:01	[SCREAMS]
17:03	[YELLS]
17:10	[GRUNTS]
17:12	I'VE GOT HIM. COME ON!
17:13	OH, WHAT? I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO KIDNAP?
17:17	AAGH!
17:21	NICE WORK.
17:26	[STRAINING]
17:29	AANG, THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
17:31	NO, KATARA, IT ISN'T.
17:32	YEAH, IT KIND OF IS.
17:35	GIVE ME THE BOY.
17:36	YOU GIVE US THE SCROLL.
17:39	YOU'RE REALLY GONNA HAND OVER THE AVATAR
17:41	FOR A STUPID PIECE OF PARCHMENT?
17:43	DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
17:45	HE'S TRYING TO TURN US AGAINST EACH OTHER.
17:46	YOUR FRIEND IS THE AVATAR?
17:49	SURE IS.
17:50	AND I'LL BET HE'LL FETCH A LOT MORE
17:52	ON THE BLACK MARKET THAN THAT FANCY SCROLL.
17:54	SHUT YOUR MOUTH,
17:55	YOU WATER TRIBE PEASANT!
17:57	YEAH, SOKKA, YOU REALLY SHOULD SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
18:00	I'M JUST SAYING,
18:01	IT'S BAD BUSINESS SENSE.
18:03	JUST IMAGINE HOW MUCH THE FIRE LORD
18:04	WOULD PAY FOR THE AVATAR.
18:06	YOU GUYS WOULD BE SET FOR LIFE.
18:08	KEEP THE SCROLL.
18:10	WE CAN BUY 100 WITH THE REWARD
18:11	WE'LL GET FOR THE KID.
18:13	YOU'LL REGRET BREAKING A DEAL WITH ME.
18:17	[GROWLS]
18:24	[SCREAMING]
18:27	[YELLING]
18:38	THANKS, MOMO.
18:39	I OWE YOU A BUSHEL OF APPLES.
18:42	[COUGHING]
18:45	[GRUNTS]
19:07	HEY!
19:10	[SQUAWKS]
19:13	[SQUAWK]
19:17	[SWORDS CLANGING]
19:21	AAH!
19:22	AANG, ARE YOU THERE?
19:24	I'M OVER HERE! FOLLOW MY VOICE.
19:27	WHERE? I CAN'T FIND YOU!
19:29	I'M RIGHT HERE!
19:35	UH, NEVER MIND.
19:36	I'LL FIND YOU!
19:38	RUN!
19:42	KATARA, YOU'RE OK.
19:44	HELP ME GET THIS BOAT BACK IN THE WATER
19:45	SO WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE.
19:47	[ALL STRAINING]
19:51	WE NEED A TEAM OF RHINOS
19:52	TO BUDGE THIS SHIP.
19:53	A TEAM OF RHINOS...
19:55	OR TWO WATERBENDERS.
20:07	Katara: EVERYBODY IN!
20:12	ARE YOU SO BUSY FIGHTING
20:13	YOU CANNOT SEE YOUR OWN SHIP
20:15	HAS SET SAIL?
20:17	WE HAVE NO TIME FOR YOUR PROVERBS, UNCLE.
20:19	IT'S NO PROVERB.
20:22	BLEEDING HOG MONKEYS!
20:24	HA HA HA HA!
20:27	[LAUGHTER]
20:30	HEY, THAT'S MY BOAT!
20:33	MAYBE IT SHOULD BE A PROVERB.
20:35	COME ON, UNCLE.
20:39	SOKKA, CAN'T YOU MAKE IT GO ANY FASTER?
20:42	I DON'T KNOW HOW.
20:43	THIS THING WASN'T MADE BY THE WATER TRIBE.
20:47	[GRUNTING]
20:52	WHOA!
20:55	WHOA!
