00:09	katara: water...

00:11	earth...

00:13	fire...

00:15	air...

00:17	long ago, the 4 nations lived together in harmony.

00:22	then, everything changed when the fire nation attacked.

00:26	only the avatar, master of all 4 elements,

00:29	could stop them.

00:30	but when the world needed him most,

00:32	he vanished.

00:33	a hundred years passed, and my brother and i

00:35	discovered the new avatar, an airbender named aang.

00:39	and although his airbending skills were great,

00:41	he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

00:45	but i believe aang can save the world.

00:59	katara: when the avatar dies, he's reincarnated

01:01	into the next nation in the cycle.

01:03	but there's no one who could teach me how to be the avatar.

01:06	monk gyatsu said that avatar roku would help me.

01:09	sokka: the avatar before you? he died over 100 years ago.

01:13	how are you supposed to talk to him?

01:14	there's a temple on a crescent-shaped island,

01:16	and if i go there on the solstice,

01:18	i'll be able to speak with him.

01:20	but the solstice is tomorrow.

01:22	yeah, and there's one more problem.

01:24	the island is in the fire nation.

01:40	let's go, appa! come on, boy.

01:42	[grunting]

01:45	look, i'm sorry, but katara and sokka aren't coming to the fire nation with us.

01:49	if they got hurt, i'd never forgive myself.

01:53	so get your big butt of the ground and let's go!

01:55	uhh...

01:56	aah!

01:58	sokka: i think his big butt

01:59	is trying to tell you something.

02:01	katara: please don't go, aang.

02:03	the world can't afford to lose you to the fire nation.

02:04	neither can i.

02:11	but i have to talk to avatar roku

02:13	to find out what my vision means.

02:15	i need to get to the fire temple

02:17	before the sun sets on the solstice.

02:19	that's today!

02:23	we're not letting you go into the fire nation, aang.

02:27	at least not without your friends.

02:29	we got your back.

02:33	ew!

02:35	it's a long journey to the crescent island.

02:37	you'll have to fly fast to have any chance

02:39	of making it before sundown.

02:41	good luck.

02:42	thank you for your--

02:43	go!

02:44	[grunt]

02:49	ah.

02:51	having trouble sleeping?

02:52	uh!

02:55	seen the avatar lately?

03:06	come on, boy. we've got a long way to go.

03:08	faster!

03:09	[grunt]

03:15	sailing into fire nation waters.

03:18	of all the foolish things you've done

03:20	in your 16 years, prince zuko,

03:23	this is the most foolish.

03:26	i have no choice, uncle.

03:28	have you completely forgotten

03:30	that the fire lord banished you?

03:32	what if you're caught?

03:34	i'm chasing the avatar.

03:36	my father will understand why i'm returning home.

03:38	you give him too much credit.

03:40	my brother is not the understanding type.

03:46	there they are.

03:48	helmsman, full steam ahead.

03:52	aang, we got trouble.

03:54	yeah, and it's gaining fast!

04:03	really, prince zuko, couldn't you shoot them down

04:06	with something more fragrant?

04:09	huh!

04:11	on my mark.

04:13	fire!

04:17	fire ball!

04:19	i'm on it!

04:24	we have to get out of zuko's range

04:26	before he shoots another hot sticker at us!

04:28	can't you make appa go any faster?

04:30	yeah, but there's just one little problem.

04:33	a blockade.

04:41	technically, you are still

04:42	in earth kingdom waters.

04:44	turn back now, and they cannot arrest you.

04:46	if we fly north,

04:48	we can go around the fire nation ships

04:49	and avoid the blockade.

04:51	it's the only way.

04:52	katara: there's no time!

04:54	this is exactly why i didn't want you to come.

04:56	it's too dangerous.

04:57	and that's exactly why we're here.

04:59	let's run this blockade.

05:02	appa, yip yip!

05:04	[appa grunts]

05:06	he's not turning around.

05:08	please, prince zuko. if the fire nation captures you,

05:11	there is nothing i can do.

05:13	do not follow the avatar.

05:15	i'm sorry, uncle.

05:18	run the blockade!

05:20	zhao: the avatar...

05:23	and the banished prince.

05:25	this must be my lucky day.

05:28	commander zhao, what are your orders?

05:30	shoot the bison down, captain.

05:33	but there's a fire navy ship out there, sir-- one of our own.

05:35	what if it's hit?

05:37	so be it. it belongs to a traitor.

05:40	ignite!

05:44	launch!

05:49	aah!

05:49	aah!

05:49	aah!

06:07	appa, are you ok?

06:10	[grunt]

06:24	prince zuko, the engines are damaged!

06:26	we need to stop and make repairs!

06:28	do not stop this ship.

06:30	launch!

06:37	aah!

06:45	[grunt]

06:47	aah!

06:47	aah!

06:47	aah!

06:50	aah!

06:52	sokka!

06:57	aah

07:01	aah!

07:05	oh!

07:16	ready.

07:23	fire!

07:26	aah!

07:32	huh!

07:37	aah! ooh!

07:45	we made it!

07:47	we got into the fire nation. great.

07:50	where do you think the avatar is headed, sir?

07:52	i'm not sure,

07:54	but i bet a certain banished prince will know.

08:00	we're on a collision course!

08:01	we can make it.

08:03	the boarding party is ready to apprehend prince zuko, sir.

08:06	wait. cut the engines

08:08	and let them pass.

08:09	sir?

08:23	[appa snoring]

08:32	there it is--

08:34	the island where roku's dragon took me.

08:42	you did it, buddy. nice flying.

08:44	[snoring]

08:45	oh, you must be tired.

08:48	no, i'm good. refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders.

08:54	i was talking to appa.

08:56	well, i was talking to momo.

09:06	sokka: i don't see any guards.

09:08	katara: the fire nation

09:09	must have abandoned the temple

09:11	when avatar roku died.

09:12	it's almost sundown. we'd better hurry.

09:23	wait. i think i heard something.

09:27	we are the fire sages, guardians of the temple of the avatar.

09:33	great. i am the avatar.

09:36	we know.

09:43	i'll hold them off. run!

09:47	uh!

09:47	uh!

09:47	uh!

09:49	if the avatar contacts roku,

09:51	there's no telling how powerful the boy will become.

09:54	split up and find him.

09:59	follow me!

10:01	do you know where you're going?

10:02	nope.

10:05	wrong way!

10:07	fire sage: come back!

10:14	i don't want to fight you. i am a friend.

10:18	firebenders aren't our friends.

10:22	i know why you're here, avatar.

10:24	you do?

10:26	yes. you wish to speak to avatar roku.

10:30	i can take you to him.

10:31	how?

10:35	uh!

10:37	this way.

10:39	zhao: find him!

10:42	time is running out! quickly!

10:53	what's he up to, uncle?

10:54	why didn't commander zhao arrest me?

10:57	because he wants to follow you.

10:59	he knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after--the avatar.

11:05	if zhao wants to follow our trail of smoke,then that's exactly what i'll let him do.

11:10	fire sage: avatar roku once called this temple his home.

11:13	he formed these secret passages out of the magma.

11:16	aang: did you know avatar roku?

11:18	no, but my grandfather knew him.

11:21	many generations of fire sages guarded this temple long before me.

11:26	we all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.

11:29	is that how you knew i was coming?

11:31	a few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred.

11:35	the statue of avatar roku--

11:37	its eyes began to glow.

11:39	katara: that's when we were at the air temple.

11:41	avatar roku's eyes were glowing there, too.

11:44	at that moment, we knew you had returned to the world.

11:48	if this is the avatar's temple,

11:50	why did the sages attack me?

11:52	things have changed.

11:54	in the past, the sages were loyal only to the avatar.

11:58	when roku died, the sages eagerly awaited for the next avatar to return,

12:03	but he never came.

12:04	they were waiting for me.

12:06	hey, don't feel bad. you're only 100 years late.

12:09	they lost hope that the avatar would ever return.

12:12	when fire lord sozen began the war,

12:15	my grandfather and the other sages

12:17	were forced to follow him.

12:20	i never wanted to serve the fire lord.

12:23	when i learned you were coming,

12:24	i knew i would have to betray the other sages.

12:27	thank you for helping me.

12:31	we'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary.

12:33	once you're inside,

12:36	wait for the light to hit avatar roku's statue.

12:39	only then will you be able to speak with him.

12:49	[gasp]

12:50	no!

12:52	shyu, what's wrong?

12:54	the sanctuary doors-- they're closed.

12:57	can't you just open them with firebending,

12:59	like you opened that other door?

13:01	shyu: no. only a fully realized avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone.

13:07	otherwise, the sages must open the doors together with 5 simultaneous fire blasts.

13:14	5 fire blasts, huh?

13:16	[ding]

13:17	i think i can help you out.

13:21	zuko: uncle, keep heading north.

13:23	zhao will follow the smoke trail

13:24	while i use it as a cover.

13:26	hmmm.

13:36	sokka: this is a little trick

13:37	i picked up from my father.

13:39	i seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing.

13:42	shyu lights the oil-soaked twine, and ta da! fake firebending.

13:47	you're really outdone yourself this time, sokka.

13:50	this might actually work.

13:54	the sages will hear the explosion,

13:56	so as soon as they go off, you rush in.

14:01	it's almost sunset. are you ready?

14:03	definitely.

14:12	ooh!

14:18	uh! uh!

14:20	they're still locked!

14:25	it didn't work.

14:36	why won't it open?! uh!

14:41	aang, stop.

14:43	there's nothing else we can do.

14:45	i'm sorry i put you through all this for nothing.

14:48	sokka: i don't get it.

14:49	that blast looked as strong as any firebending i've seen.

14:53	sokka, you're a genius!

14:56	wait. how is sokka a genius?

14:58	his plan didn't even work.

15:00	come on, aang. let her dream.

15:02	you're right. sokka's plan didn't work,

15:06	but it looks like it did.

15:08	did the definition of genius change in the last hundred years?

15:12	fire sage: come quickly! the avatar has entered the sanctuary!

15:15	how did he get in?

15:16	i know, but look at the scorch marks,

15:19	and down there.

15:22	he's inside. open the doors immediately

15:25	before he contacts avatar roku.

15:31	huh!

15:31	huh!

15:42	[sneeze]

15:43	it's the avatar's lemur.

15:45	he must have crawled through the pipes.

15:47	we've been tricked!

15:49	[yowling]

15:49	aah!

15:53	now, aang.

15:55	aang, now's your chance!

15:59	the avatar's coming with me.

16:01	uh! uh!

16:04	uh!

16:06	close the doors, quickly!

16:13	uh!

16:13	aah!

16:16	go!

16:24	he made it!

16:38	the light hits the statue, and i talk to roku.

16:41	so why isn't anything happening?

16:44	huh!

16:44	huh!

16:48	why isn't it working? it's sealed shut.

16:50	it must have been the light.

16:52	avatar roku doesn't want us inside.

16:57	aang: why isn't anything happening?

17:00	i don't know what i'm doing.

17:01	all i know is airbending.

17:03	please, avatar roku, talk to me.

17:13	it's good to see you, aang.

17:15	what took you so long?

17:22	zuko: why did you help the avatar?

17:24	because it was once the sage's duty.

17:27	it is still our duty.

17:30	[one person clapping]

17:33	what a moving and heartfelt performance.

17:37	i'm certain the fire lord will understand

17:40	when you explain why you betrayed him.

17:43	commander zhao--

17:44	zhao: and, prince zuko,

17:46	it was a noble effort, but your little smokescreen didn't work.

17:52	two traitors in one day.

17:55	the fire lord will be pleased.

17:57	you're too late, zhao.

17:58	the avatar's inside,

18:00	and the doors are sealed.

18:01	no matter. sooner or later,

18:04	he has to come out.

18:10	i have something very important to tell you, aang.

18:14	that is why, when you were in the spirit world,

18:18	i sent my dragon to find you.

18:21	is it about that vision--the one of the comet?

18:23	yes.

18:25	what does it mean?

18:26	100 years ago,

18:28	fire lord sozen used that comet to begin the war.

18:32	he and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations.

18:42	so the comet made them stronger?

18:44	yes, stronger than you could even imagine.

18:48	but that happened a hundred years ago.

18:50	what does the comet have to do with the war now?

18:52	listen carefully.

18:54	sozen's comet will return by the end of this summer, and fire lord ozai will use its power to finish the war once and for all.

19:03	aah!

19:05	if he succeeds, even the avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world.

19:11	aang, you must defeat the fire lord

19:15	before the comet arrives.

19:17	but i haven't even started learning waterbending,not to mention earth and fire.

19:22	mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice,

19:26	but if the world is to survive,

19:28	you must do it by summer's end.

19:39	zhao: when those doors open,unleash all your firepower.

19:43	how's aang gonna make it out of this?

19:45	how are we gonna make it out of this?

19:50	what if i can't master all the elements in time?

19:52	what if i fail?

19:54	i know you can do it, aang,

19:56	for you have done it before.

19:59	the solstice is ending.

20:02	we must go our separate ways for now.

20:06	but i won't be able to come back to the temple.

20:09	what if i have questions?

20:10	how will i talk to you?

20:11	i am a part of you.

20:14	when you need to talk to me again,

20:17	you will find a way.

20:21	a great danger awaits you at the temple.

20:25	i can help you face the threat, but only if you are ready.

20:32	i'm ready.

20:43	zhao: ready...

20:46	no! aang!

20:48	fire!

20:56	avatar roku!

21:00	uh!

21:00	uh!

21:03	uh!

21:08	oh!

21:08	oh!

21:10	avatar roku is going to destroy the temple.

21:12	we have to get out of here!

21:13	not without aang!

21:15	huh!

21:45	we got you back.

21:47	thanks. where's shyu?

21:48	i don't know.

21:55	uh!

21:55	uh!

21:55	uh!

22:00	[gasps]

22:15	no prince, no avatar.

22:18	apparently the only thing i do have is 5 traitors.

22:23	but, commander, only shyu helped the avatar.

22:26	save your stories for the fire lord.

22:28	as far as i'm concerned,you are all guilty.

22:32	take them to the prison hole!
