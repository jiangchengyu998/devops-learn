00:10	katara, voice-over: water.

00:11	earth.

00:13	fire.

00:15	air.

00:17	long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.

00:21	then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.

00:25	only the avatar, master of all four elements,

00:28	could stop them.

00:30	but when the world needed him most,

00:32	he vanished.

00:34	a hundred years passed, and my brother and i

00:36	discovered the new avatar, an airbender named aang.

00:39	and although his airbending skills were great,

00:41	he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

00:45	but i believe aang can save the world.

00:58	it's been so long since i've had hope,

01:01	but you brought it back to life, my little waterbender.

01:04	aang is the avatar.

01:07	you both found him for a reason.

01:09	now your destinies are intertwined with his.

01:13	according to legend, you need to first master water,

01:16	then earth, then fire, right?

01:18	that's what the monks told me.

01:19	well, if we go to the north pole,

01:22	you can master waterbending.

01:23	we could learn it together!

01:26	there have been multiple sightings of the avatar,

01:29	but he is impossible to track down.

01:32	this coward's hundred years in hiding are over.

01:40	[birds singing]

01:51	[momo chattering]

01:54	great. you're back. what's for dinner?

01:57	we've got a few options.

01:59	first, round nuts and some kind of oval-shaped nuts.

02:02	and some rock-shaped nuts that might just be rocks.

02:08	dig in.

02:09	seriously, what else you got?

02:13	[purring]

02:19	[boom]

02:20	sokka: what was that?

02:25	[boom]

02:27	aang: it's coming from over there.

02:30	sokka: shouldn't we run away from huge booms, not toward them?

02:36	[purring]

02:43	hyah.

02:45	an earthbender.

02:46	let's go meet him.

02:48	he looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously.

02:50	hello there! i'm katara.

02:52	what's your name?

02:54	ah!

03:01	aang: nice to meet you!

03:04	i just wanted to say hi.

03:06	hey, that guy's got to be running somewhere.

03:08	maybe we're near a village.

03:10	and i bet that village has a market.

03:13	which means no nuts for dinner.

03:15	hey! i worked hard to get those nuts.

03:17	[purring]

03:18	yeah, i hate them, too.

03:27	aang: great hat.

03:30	i'll trade you some nuts for it.

03:34	hey!

03:37	hi, mom.

03:38	where have you been, haru?

03:40	you're late!

03:41	get started on your chores.

03:43	hey! you're that kid.

03:44	ah!

03:46	why did you run away before?

03:48	uh...you must have me confused with some other kid.

03:50	no, she doesn't. we saw you earthbending.

03:54	they saw you doing what?

03:56	they're crazy, mom.

03:58	i mean, look at how they're dressed.

04:01	you know how dangerous that is.

04:04	you know what would happen if they caught you earthbending.

04:07	man: open up!

04:08	[loud knocking]

04:10	sokka: fire nation. act natural.

04:22	aah!

04:24	what do you want? i've already paid you this week.

04:27	the tax just doubled.

04:29	we wouldn't want an accident, would we?

04:31	fire is sometimes so hard to control.

04:43	you can keep the copper ones.

04:50	nice guy.

04:52	how long has the fire nation been here?

04:54	five years. fire lord ozai

04:57	uses our town's coal mines to fuel his ships.

04:59	they're thugs. they steal from us.

05:02	and everyone here is too much of a coward

05:04	to do anything about it.

05:05	quiet, haru!

05:06	don't talk like that!

05:08	but haru's an earthbender.

05:09	he can help.

05:11	earthbending is forbidden.

05:12	it's caused nothing but misery for this village.

05:15	he must never use his abilities.

05:17	how can you say that?

05:19	haru has a gift.

05:21	asking him not to earthbend

05:22	is like asking me not to waterbend.

05:25	it's a part of who we are.

05:26	you don't understand.

05:28	i understand that haru can help you fight back.

05:31	what can the fire nation do to you

05:33	that they haven't done already?

05:34	they could take haru away,

05:37	like they took his father.

05:47	haru: my mom said you can sleep here tonight.

05:49	but you should leave in the morning.

05:51	thanks. i'll make sure appa doesn't eat all your hay.

05:59	katara: i'm sorry about what i said earlier.

06:02	i didn't know about your father.

06:03	haru: that's ok.

06:05	it's funny. the way you were talking back in the store,

06:08	it reminded me of him.

06:10	thanks.

06:11	my father was very courageous.

06:13	when the fire nation invaded,

06:15	he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered 10 to 1.

06:18	but they fought back anyway.

06:19	he sounds like a great man.

06:21	after the attack, they rounded up my father

06:25	and every other earthbender

06:27	and took them away. we haven't seen them since.

06:30	so that's why you hide your earthbending.

06:32	yeah.

06:33	the problem is,

06:35	the only way i can feel close to my father now

06:38	is when i practice my bending.

06:42	he taught me everything i know.

06:44	see this necklace?

06:48	my mother gave it to me.

06:49	it's beautiful.

06:51	i lost my mother in a fire nation raid.

06:53	this necklace is all i have left of her.

06:55	it's not enough, is it?

06:57	no.

07:04	aah! help!

07:05	the mine!

07:06	aah...

07:09	help me!

07:12	[moaning]

07:14	[rumbling]

07:17	ah! it's not working.

07:19	we have to get help.

07:21	there's no time. pull harder!

07:23	haru, there's a way you can help him.

07:25	i can't.

07:27	please. there's no one around to see you.

07:29	it's the only way!

07:40	ah!

07:43	haru, you did it!

07:51	[purring]

07:53	it was so brave of haru to use his earthbending

07:56	to help that old man.

07:58	you must have really inspired him.

08:00	i guess so.

08:01	everyone should get some sleep.

08:03	we're leaving at dawn.

08:04	dawn? can't we sleep in for once?

08:05	absolutely not!

08:07	this village is crawling with fire nation troops.

08:09	if they discover you're here, aang,

08:11	we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast.

08:13	good night.

08:14	i'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.

08:16	good night.

08:17	[laughing]

08:40	ah!

08:41	that's him!

08:42	that's the earthbender!

08:44	aah!

09:13	they took him!

09:15	they took haru away!

09:15	what?

09:17	the old man turned him in to the fire nation.

09:19	it's all my fault. i forced him into earthbending.

09:22	slow down, katara. when did this happen?

09:25	haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.

09:27	then it's too late to track him. he's long gone.

09:29	we don't need to track him.

09:31	the fire nation is going to

09:32	take me right to haru.

09:33	and why would they do that?

09:36	because they're going to arrest me for earthbending.

09:42	i thought you were crazy at first, katara,

09:44	but this might work.

09:46	there are ventilation shafts throughout these mines.

09:47	all aang has to do is send an air current

09:49	from that vent to this one right here.

09:51	the boulder levitates and ta-da--

09:53	fake earthbending.

09:55	aang, did you get all that?

09:57	sure, sure. i got it.

09:58	do you remember your cue?

10:00	yeah, yeah. just relax.

10:02	you're taking all the fun out of this.

10:04	by "this" do you mean intentionally being captured

10:07	by an army of ruthless firebenders?

10:09	exactly. that's fun stuff.

10:11	sokka: here they come. get in your places.

10:15	uh! get out of my way, pipsqueak.

10:18	how dare you call me pipsqueak,

10:21	you giant-eared cretin?

10:23	what did you call me?

10:25	a giant-eared cretin.

10:27	look at those things.

10:29	do herds of animals use them for shade?

10:31	you better back off!

10:33	seriously, back off.

10:34	i will not back off!

10:36	i bet elephants get together

10:38	and make fun of how large your ears are.

10:41	that's it! you're going down.

10:43	i'll show you who's boss,

10:46	earthbending style.

10:51	i said, "earthbending style!"

10:59	that lemur. he's earthbending.

11:03	no, you idiot. it's the girl.

11:06	oh. of course.

11:08	i'll hold her!

11:11	[whispering] you've got 12 hours to find haru.

11:13	we'll be right behind you.

11:22	momo, you have some big ears.

11:25	[purring]

12:03	she'll be fine, aang. katara knows what she's doing.

12:15	man: earthbenders, it is my pleasure to welcome you

12:18	aboard my modest shipyard.

12:21	i am your warden.

12:23	i prefer to think of you not as prisoners,

12:26	but as honored guests.

12:29	and i hope you come to think of me

12:32	as your humble and caring host.

12:35	you will succeed here if you simply abide--

12:38	[coughing]

12:40	hyah!

12:44	what kind of guest dishonors his host by interrupting him?

12:48	take him below.

12:50	one week in solitary will improve his manners.

12:54	simply treat me with the courtesy i give you

12:57	and we'll get along famously.

13:01	you will notice, earthbenders,

13:04	that this rig is made entirely of metal.

13:07	you are miles away from any rock or earth.

13:11	so, if you have any illusions about employing

13:14	that brutish savagery that passes for bending

13:17	among you people, forget them.

13:21	it is impossible.

13:24	good day.

13:51	katara?

13:53	haru!

13:54	what are you doing here?

13:56	it's my fault you were captured.

13:57	i came to rescue you.

13:59	so you got yourself arrested?

14:01	it was the only way to find you.

14:03	you've got guts, katara. i'll give you that.

14:06	come on. there's someone i want you to meet.

14:09	katara, this is my father, tyro.

14:14	dad, this is katara.

14:16	it's an honor to meet you.

14:18	have some dinner, katara.

14:21	ew.

14:24	it's not as bad as it looks.

14:28	eew!

14:29	it's still pretty bad, though.

14:31	tyro, the prisoners are complaining

14:33	there aren't enough blankets to go around.

14:35	i'll talk to the guards.

14:37	in the meantime, make sure the elderly are taken care of.

14:39	the rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather.

14:43	if you don't mind me asking,

14:44	what's your escape plan?

14:45	excuse me?

14:47	you know, the plan to get everyone off the rig?

14:49	what is it? mutiny, sabotage?

14:51	the plan? the plan is to survive,

14:54	wait out this war, hope that one day

14:57	some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened.

15:00	how can you say that?

15:01	you sound like you've already given up.

15:03	katara, i admire your courage.

15:06	and i envy your youth.

15:08	but people's lives are at stake here.

15:11	the warden is a ruthless man,

15:13	and he won't stand for any rebellion.

15:16	i'm sorry, but we're powerless.

15:19	we'll see about that.

15:24	earthbenders!

15:26	you don't know me, but i know of you.

15:29	every child in my water tribe village was rocked to sleep

15:33	with stories of the brave earth kingdom

15:35	and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.

15:38	some of you may think that the fire nation

15:40	has made you powerless.

15:43	yes. they have taken away your ability to bend.

15:45	but they can't take away your courage.

15:48	and it is your courage they should truly fear,

15:50	because it runs deeper than any mine

15:53	you've been forced to dig,

15:55	any ocean that keeps you far from home.

15:57	it is the strength of your hearts

15:59	that make you who you are,

16:01	hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone

16:04	has eroded away.

16:05	the time to fight back is now!

16:08	i can tell you the avatar has returned!

16:11	so remember your courage, earthbenders!

16:13	let us fight for our freedom!

16:17	[man coughing]

16:50	ah!

16:51	shh.

16:56	your 12 hours are up. where is haru?

16:57	we've got to get out of here.

16:59	i can't.

17:01	we don't have much time. there are guards everywhere.

17:03	get on!

17:05	katara, what's wrong?

17:06	i'm not leaving.

17:08	i'm not giving up on these people.

17:16	sokka: what do you mean, you're not leaving?

17:19	we can't abandon these people.

17:20	there has to be a way to help them.

17:22	maybe she's right. what do you say, sokka?

17:25	i say you're both crazy.

17:29	last chance. we need to leave now.

17:31	no.

17:33	i hate when you get like this.

17:35	come on, we better hide.

17:38	[whispering] go.

17:44	look!

17:46	tell me exactly what you saw.

17:49	well, sir, it looked like a flying bison.

17:51	what?

17:53	it was a giant, flying buffalo, sir,

17:54	with an empty saddle.

17:56	which was it, a buffalo or a bison?

17:58	i-i-i'm not sure what the difference is,

18:01	but that's not really the point, is it, sir?

18:03	i'll decide what the point is, fool!

18:06	aah!

18:08	[splash]

18:10	you! wake up the captain! search the entire rig!

18:13	sir.

18:15	what?

18:16	that was the captain you just threw overboard, so--

18:19	then wake up someone i haven't thrown overboard

18:22	and search the rig.

18:24	there's something going on here, and i don't like it.

18:30	[purring]

18:33	we don't have much time. what are we gonna do?

18:37	i wish i knew how to make a hurricane.

18:40	the warden would run away, and we would steal his keys.

18:42	wouldn't he just take his keys with him?

18:45	i'm just tossing ideas around.

18:47	i tried talking the earthbenders

18:48	into fighting back, but it didn't work.

18:51	if there was just a way to help them help themselves.

18:54	for that they need some kind of earth or some rock,

18:58	something they can bend.

19:00	but this entire place is made of metal.

19:04	no, it's not. look at the smoke.

19:06	i bet they're burning coal.

19:09	in other words...

19:11	earth.

19:16	it's almost dawn. we're running out of time.

19:18	you sure this is gonna work?

19:20	it should.

19:22	these vents reminded me of our little trick

19:23	back at the village.

19:25	we're gonna do the same thing,

19:26	but on a much bigger scale.

19:28	there's a huge deposit of coal at the base of this island.

19:30	and the whole system is ventilated.

19:32	aang closed off all the vents except one.

19:34	when he does his airbending,

19:36	the coal only has one place to go--

19:38	right back here.

19:39	man: there's the intruder!

19:41	stay back! i'm warning you!

19:43	katara, stop. you can't win this fight.

19:48	listen to him well, child.

19:51	you're one mistake away

19:53	from dying where you stand.

20:13	[coughing]

20:16	here's your chance, earthbenders!

20:18	take it! your fate is in your own hands!

20:25	[warden laughing]

20:29	foolish girl.

20:31	you thought a few inspirational words

20:34	and some coal would change these people?

20:38	look at these blank hopeless faces.

20:42	their spirits were broken a long time ago.

20:45	oh, but you still believed in them.

20:48	how sweet.

20:51	they're a waste of your energy, little girl.

20:54	you failed.

21:01	grr.

21:04	hyah!

21:11	show no mercy!

21:15	aah!
21:17	for the earth kingdom,
21:18	attack!
21:20	[all yelling]
21:51	[screaming]
21:55	get to the ship! we'll hold them off!
21:57	do not let them escape!
22:02	guys, throw me some coal!
22:18	no, please. i can't swim.
22:22	don't worry. i hear cowards float.
22:27	[screaming]
22:34	i want to thank you for saving me,
22:37	for saving us.
22:39	all it took was a little coal.
22:41	it wasn't the coal, katara.
22:43	it was you.
22:45	thank you for helping me find my courage,
22:48	katara of the water tribe.
22:49	my family and everyone here
22:52	owes you much.
22:54	so, i guess you're going home now.
22:57	yes, to take back my village.
22:59	to take back all of our villages!
23:02	the fire nation will regret the day
23:04	they set foot on our land!
23:06	[cheering]
23:07	come with us.
23:08	i can't.
23:10	your mission is to take back your home.
23:12	ours is to get aang to the north pole.
23:15	that's him, isn't it? the avatar.
23:20	katara, thank you for bringing my father back to me.
23:23	i never thought i'd see him again.
23:26	i only wish there was some way--
23:27	i know.
23:29	my mother's necklace! it's gone!
