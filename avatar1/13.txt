00:09	Katara: WATER...
00:10	EARTH...
00:12	FIRE...
00:14	AIR.
00:16	LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.
00:20	THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.
00:25	ONLY THE AVATAR, MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,
00:27	COULD STOP THEM.
00:29	BUT WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED HIM MOST,
00:31	HE VANISHED.
00:32	A HUNDRED YEARS PASSED,
00:34	AND MY BROTHER AND I DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR,
00:36	AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG,
00:38	AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING SKILLS ARE GREAT,
00:40	HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN BEFORE HE'S READY TO SAVE ANYONE.
00:44	BUT I BELIEVE AANG CAN SAVE THE WORLD.
00:56	YOU RAN AWAY.
00:58	AND THEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED OUR TEMPLE.
01:00	MY PEOPLE NEEDED ME, AND I WASN'T THERE TO HELP.
01:03	I'M DONE DWELLING ON THE PAST.
01:05	I'M HERE NOW, AND I'M GOING TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT.
01:07	COMMANDER ZHAO, I'VE BEEN HUNTING THE AVATAR FOR TWO YEARS AND I--
01:09	AND YOU FAILED.
01:11	CAPTURING THE AVATAR IS TOO IMPORTANT TO LEAVE IN A TEENAGER'S HANDS.
01:14	HE'S MINE NOW.
01:16	SO THAT'S WHY HE'S SO OBSESSED.
01:19	CAPTURING THE AVATAR IS THE ONLY CHANCE HE HAS
01:22	OF THINGS RETURNING TO NORMAL.
01:23	BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS
01:25	THE AVATAR GIVES ZUKO HOPE.
01:38	[BIRD CALLS]
01:58	ABSOLUTELY NOT.
02:00	THE YU YAN ARCHERS STAY HERE.
02:03	YOUR REQUEST IS DENIED, COMMANDER ZHAO.
02:06	COLONEL SHINU, PLEASE RECONSIDER.
02:09	THEIR PRECISION IS LEGENDARY.
02:12	THE YU YAN CAN PIN A FLY TO A TREE FROM 100 YARDS AWAY
02:14	WITHOUT KILLING IT.
02:18	YOU'RE WASTING THEIR TALENTS USING THEM AS MERE SECURITY GUARDS.
02:22	I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT WITH THEIR TALENTS.
02:25	THEY'RE MY ARCHERS, AND WHAT I SAY GOES.
02:28	BUT MY SEARCH FOR THE AVATAR IS--
02:30	IS NOTHING BUT A VANITY PROJECT.
02:32	WE'RE FIGHTING A REAL WAR HERE,
02:34	AND I NEED EVERY MAN I'VE GOT, COMMANDER.
02:36	BUT--
02:38	THAT'S FINAL!
02:39	I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT.
02:43	[BIRD SCREECHES]
02:51	NEWS FROM FIRE LORD OZAI?
02:56	IT APPEARS I'VE BEEN PROMOTED TO ADMIRAL.
02:58	MY REQUEST IS NOW AN ORDER.
03:18	[COUGHING]
03:23	THIS SHOULD BRING YOUR FEVER DOWN.
03:26	YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT APPA THE MOST?
03:29	HIS SENSE OF HUMOR.
03:31	THAT'S NICE.
03:32	I'LL TELL HIM.
03:34	HA HA HA!
03:36	CLASSIC APPA.
03:37	HOW'S SOKKA DOING?
03:38	NOT SO GOOD.
03:40	BEING OUT IN THAT STORM
03:41	REALLY DID A NUMBER ON HIM.
03:42	[SHIVERING]
03:45	I COULDN'T FIND ANY GINGER ROOT FOR THE TEA,
03:48	BUT I FOUND A MAP.
03:49	THERE'S AN HERBALIST INSTITUTE
03:51	ON THE TOP OF THAT MOUNTAIN.
03:53	WE COULD PROBABLY FIND A CURE FOR SOKKA THERE.
03:54	AANG, HE'S IN NO CONDITION TO TRAVEL.
03:57	SOKKA JUST NEEDS MORE REST.
03:59	I'M SURE HE'LL BE BETTER BY TOMORROW.
04:01	[COUGHING]
04:05	NOT YOU, TOO.
04:06	RELAX. IT WAS JUST A LITTLE COUGH.
04:08	I'M FIN--
04:09	[COUGHING]
04:16	THAT'S HOW SOKKA STARTED YESTERDAY.
04:18	NOW LOOK AT HIM.
04:19	HE THINKS HE'S AN EARTHBENDER.
04:21	TAKE THAT, YOU ROCK.
04:24	A FEW MORE HOURS AND YOU'LL BE TALKING NONSENSE, TOO.
04:27	I'M GOING TO FIND SOME MEDICINE.
04:34	UH, MAYBE IT'S SAFER IF I GO ON FOOT.
04:37	KEEP AN EYE ON THEM, GUYS.
04:41	HA HA!
04:43	YOU GUYS ARE KILLING ME.
04:57	WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PICK UP THE AVATAR'S TRAIL SINCE THE STORM,
05:00	BUT IF WE CONTINUE HEADING NORTHEAST...
05:05	WHAT DO THEY WANT?
05:06	PERHAPS A SPORTING GAME OF PAI SHO.
05:14	THE HUNT FOR THE AVATAR
05:16	HAS BEEN GIVEN PRIME IMPORTANCE.
05:18	ALL INFORMATION REGARDING THE AVATAR
05:19	MUST BE REPORTED DIRECTLY TO ADMIRAL ZHAO.
05:22	ZHAO HAS BEEN PROMOTED?
05:24	WELL, GOOD FOR HIM.
05:27	I'VE GOT NOTHING TO REPORT TO ZHAO.
05:29	NOW GET OFF MY SHIP AND LET US PASS.
05:32	ADMIRAL ZHAO IS NOT ALLOWING SHIPS
05:34	IN OR OUT OF THIS AREA.
05:36	OFF MY SHIP!
05:38	EXCELLENT.
05:40	I TAKE THE POT.
05:43	BUT YOU'RE ALL IMPROVING.
05:45	I'M CERTAIN YOU WILL WIN IF WE PLAY AGAIN.
05:54	IT SAYS HERE THAT THE AVATAR CAN CREATE TORNADOS
05:57	AND RUN FASTER THAN THE WIND.
05:59	PRETTY AMAZING.
06:01	AW, THAT'S JUST A BUNCH OF FIRE LORD PROPAGANDA.
06:03	THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S TRUE.
06:13	[BLOWS HORN]
06:20	KATARA, PLEASE, WATER.
06:23	LISTEN CAREFULLY, MOMO.
06:26	I NEED YOU TO TAKE THIS TO THE RIVER AND FILL IT WITH WATER.
06:31	[HEARING GIBBERISH]
06:35	GOT IT?
06:56	HELLO. I'M SORRY TO BARGE IN LIKE THIS,
06:58	BUT I NEED SOME MEDICINE FOR MY FRIENDS.
07:00	THEY HAVE FEVERS AND THEY'VE BEEN COUGHING--
07:01	SETTLE DOWN, YOUNG MAN.
07:03	YOUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE FINE.
07:07	I'VE BEEN UP HERE FOR OVER 40 YEARS, YOU KNOW.
07:11	USED TO BE OTHERS, BUT THEY ALL LEFT YEARS AGO.
07:14	NOW IT'S JUST ME AND MIYUKI.
07:18	THAT'S NICE.
07:20	WOUNDED EARTH KINGDOM TROOPS STILL COME BY NOW AND AGAIN.
07:23	BRAVE BOYS,
07:25	AND THANKS TO MY REMEDIES,
07:27	THEY ALWAYS LEAVE IN BETTER SHAPE THAN WHEN THEY ARRIVED.
07:31	THAT'S NICE. ARE YOU ALMOST DONE?
07:33	HOLD ON.
07:34	I JUST NEED TO ADD ONE LAST INGREDIENT.
07:37	OH, SANDALWOOD?
07:40	OH, YES-- NO, THAT WON'T DO.
07:42	BANANA LEAF? EH, NOPE.
07:44	GINGER ROOT?
07:46	UH-UH.
07:47	OH, WHERE IS THAT PESKY LITTLE PLANT?
07:56	IS EVERYTHING OK?
07:58	IT'S BEEN ALMOST AN HOUR
08:01	AND YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN THE MEN AN ORDER.
08:03	I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY DO.
08:05	DON'T GIVE UP HOPE YET.
08:07	YOU CAN STILL FIND THE AVATAR BEFORE ZHAO.
08:09	HOW, UNCLE?
08:11	WITH ZHAO'S RESOURCES,
08:12	IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
08:14	BEFORE HE CAPTURES THE AVATAR.
08:15	MY HONOR, MY THRONE, MY COUNTRY--
08:19	I'M ABOUT TO LOSE THEM ALL.
08:23	OH, HERE'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
08:26	PLUM BLOSSOM.
08:29	FINALLY. THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP.
08:31	HANDS OFF.
08:33	WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
08:34	TAKING THE CURE TO MY FRIENDS.
08:36	OH! HA HA! THIS ISN'T A CURE.
08:39	IT'S MIYUKI'S DINNER.
08:41	PLUM BLOSSOM IS HER FAVORITE.
08:43	WHAT ABOUT MY FRIENDS?
08:45	WELL, ALL THEY NEED IS SOME FROZEN WOOD FROGS.
08:49	THERE'S PLENTY OF THEM DOWN IN THE VALLEY SWAMP.
08:51	WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH FROZEN FROGS?
08:54	WHY, SUCK ON THEM, OF COURSE.
08:56	SUCK ON THEM?
08:57	THE FROG SKIN EXCRETES A SUBSTANCE
09:00	THAT'LL CURE YOUR FRIENDS,
09:02	BUT MAKE SURE YOU GET PLENTY.
09:04	ONCE THOSE LITTLE CRITTERS THAW OUT,
09:06	THEY'RE USELESS.
09:09	YOU'RE INSANE, AREN'T YOU?
09:10	THAT'S RIGHT.
09:13	WELL, DON'T STAND THERE ALL DAY.
09:16	GO!
09:20	UH! WHOA!
09:34	UH, I THINK YOU DROPPED THIS.
09:57	AAH!
10:29	A FROG!
11:10	SO THIS IS THE GREAT AVATAR,
11:13	MASTER OF ALL THE ELEMENTS.
11:16	I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'VE MANAGED TO ELUDE
11:19	THE FIRE NATION FOR 100 YEARS,
11:21	BUT YOUR LITTLE GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK IS OVER.
11:25	I'VE NEVER HIDDEN FROM YOU.
11:27	UNTIE ME AND I'LL FIGHT YOU RIGHT NOW.
11:29	UH, NO.
11:32	TELL ME, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE ONLY AIRBENDER LEFT?
11:36	DO YOU MISS YOUR PEOPLE?
11:39	OH, DON'T WORRY.
11:41	YOU WON'T BE KILLED LIKE THEY WERE.
11:43	SEE, IF YOU DIE, YOU'LL JUST BE REBORN
11:46	AND THE FIRE NATION WILL HAVE TO BEGIN
11:47	ITS SEARCH FOR THE AVATAR ALL OVER AGAIN.
11:50	SO I'LL KEEP YOU ALIVE, BUT JUST BARELY.
12:00	BLOW ALL THE WIND YOU WANT.
12:02	YOUR SITUATION IS FUTILE.
12:05	THERE IS NO ESCAPING THIS FORTRESS
12:07	AND NO ONE IS COMING TO RESCUE YOU.
12:15	[COUGHING]
12:17	WATER.
12:19	MOMO SHOULD BE BACK ANY MINUTE.
12:27	NO, MOMO.
12:28	WATER.
12:30	WA-TER.
12:34	AANG, WHAT IN THE WORLD IS TAKING YOU SO LONG?
13:12	ALL CLEAR.
13:25	ALL CLEAR.
13:26	GO ON IN.
13:48	WE ARE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF FIRE, THE SUPERIOR ELEMENT,
13:53	UNTIL TODAY, ONLY ONE THING STOOD IN OUR PATH TO VICTORY--
13:58	THE AVATAR!
14:00	I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT HE IS NOW MY PRISONER!
14:04	[CHEERING]
14:07	THIS IS THE YEAR SOZEN'S COMET RETURNS TO GRANT US ITS POWER!
14:12	[CROWD CHEERING]
14:13	THIS IS THE YEAR THE FIRE NATION
14:16	BREAKS THROUGH THE WALLS OF BA SING SE,
14:19	AND BURNS THE CITY TO THE GROUND.
14:22	[CHEERING]
14:40	WHAT? NO!
14:42	DON'T LEAVE, FROGS. MY FRIENDS ARE SICK AND THEY NEED YOU.
14:45	PLEASE GO BACK TO BEING FROZEN.
14:52	[RIBBIT RIBBIT]
15:07	[PUNCHES BEING THROWN]
15:32	[PUNCHES BEING THROWN]
15:43	AAH!
15:49	AAH!
16:01	WHO ARE YOU? WHAT'S GOING ON?
16:04	ARE YOU HERE TO RESCUE ME?
16:08	I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.
16:15	MY FROGS!
16:17	COME BACK!
16:18	AND STOP THAWING OUT!
16:21	WAIT!
16:22	MY FRIENDS NEED TO SUCK ON THOSE FROGS!
16:30	HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MOMO?
16:33	WE NEED WATER.
16:35	WA-TER.
16:38	OH, FORGET IT.
16:40	AANG, PLEASE HURRY.
16:43	WHO IS THIS AANG KID YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT, YOUR HIGHNESS?
17:13	I WANT A FULL TRANSCRIPTION OF MY SPEECH
17:16	SENT TO THE FIRE LORD,
17:17	ALONG WITH GLOWING TESTIMONIALS
17:20	FROM ALL OF THE RANKING OFFICERS PRESENT, AND--
17:22	[MEN GRUNTING]
17:29	[RIBBIT]
17:33	SIR, SHALL I HOLD OFF SENDING THAT SPEECH TO THE FIRE LORD?
17:42	[NOISY CHIMES RINGING]
17:45	THERE. ON THE WALL!
17:47	AAH!
17:54	THE AVATAR HAS ESCAPED!
17:57	CLOSE ALL THE GATES IMMEDIATELY.
17:59	STAY CLOSE TO ME.
18:47	AAH!
19:00	AAH!
19:22	[YELLS]
19:25	TAKE THIS.
19:27	JUMP ON MY BACK!
19:35	GIVE ME THE NEXT ONE!
19:54	HOLD YOUR FIRE!
19:56	THE AVATAR MUST BE CAPTURED ALIVE.
20:05	OPEN THE GATE.
20:07	ADMIRAL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
20:08	LET THEM OUT.
20:10	NOW!
20:14	HOW COULD YOU LET THEM GO?
20:16	A SITUATION LIKE THIS REQUIRES...PRECISION.
20:34	DO YOU HAVE A CLEAR SHOT?
20:38	KNOCK OUT THE THIEF.
20:41	I'LL DELIVER HIM TO THE FIRE LORD ALONG WITH THE AVATAR.
20:59	QUICK!
21:00	RECOVER THE AVATAR!
21:26	[RIBBIT]
21:45	YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORST PART
21:47	ABOUT BEING BORN OVER 100 YEARS AGO IS?
21:49	I MISS ALL THE FRIENDS I USED TO HANG OUT WITH.
21:52	BEFORE THE WAR STARTED,
21:53	I USED TO ALWAYS VISIT MY FRIEND, KUZON.
21:56	THE TWO OF US, WE'D GET IN AND OUT
21:58	OF SO MUCH TROUBLE TOGETHER.
22:00	HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST FRIENDS I EVER HAD...
22:03	AND HE WAS FROM THE FIRE NATION, JUST LIKE YOU.
22:06	IF WE KNEW EACH OTHER BACK THEN,
22:08	DO YOU THINK WE COULD HAVE BEEN FRIENDS, TOO?
22:32	WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, PRINCE ZUKO?
22:34	YOU MISSED MUSIC NIGHT.
22:36	LIEUTENANT JEE SANG A STIRRING LOVE SONG.
22:40	I'M GOING TO BED.
22:42	NO DISTURBANCES.
22:46	[PLAYING INSTRUMENT]
22:54	SUCK ON THESE.
22:56	IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
23:00	AANG, HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?
23:03	DID YOU MAKE ANY NEW FRIENDS?
23:05	NO.
23:06	I DON'T THINK I DID.
23:24	MM!
23:25	THIS IS TASTY.
23:27	MM, MM!
23:28	[RIBBIT]
23:30	PTOOEY!
23:31	AAH!
