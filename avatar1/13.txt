00:09	katara: water...
00:10	earth...
00:12	fire...
00:14	air.
00:16	long ago, the 4 nations lived together in harmony.
00:20	then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
00:25	only the avatar, master of all 4 elements,
00:27	could stop them.
00:29	but when the world needed him most,
00:31	he vanished.
00:32	a hundred years passed,
00:34	and my brother and i discovered the new avatar,
00:36	an airbender named aang,
00:38	and although his airbending skills are great,
00:40	he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
00:44	but i believe aang can save the world.
00:56	you ran away.
00:58	and then the fire nation attacked our temple.
01:00	my people needed me, and i wasn't there to help.
01:03	i'm done dwelling on the past.
01:05	i'm here now, and i'm going to make the most of it.
01:07	commander zhao, i've been hunting the avatar for two years and i--
01:09	and you failed.
01:11	capturing the avatar is too important to leave in a teenager's hands.
01:14	he's mine now.
01:16	so that's why he's so obsessed.
01:19	capturing the avatar is the only chance he has
01:22	of things returning to normal.
01:23	but the important thing is
01:25	the avatar gives zuko hope.
01:38	[bird calls]
01:58	absolutely not.
02:00	the yu yan archers stay here.
02:03	your request is denied, commander zhao.
02:06	colonel shinu, please reconsider.
02:09	their precision is legendary.
02:12	the yu yan can pin a fly to a tree from 100 yards away
02:14	without killing it.
02:18	you're wasting their talents using them as mere security guards.
02:22	i can do whatever i want with their talents.
02:25	they're my archers, and what i say goes.
02:28	but my search for the avatar is--
02:30	is nothing but a vanity project.
02:32	we're fighting a real war here,
02:34	and i need every man i've got, commander.
02:36	but--
02:38	that's final!
02:39	i don't want to hear another word about it.
02:43	[bird screeches]
02:51	news from fire lord ozai?
02:56	it appears i've been promoted to admiral.
02:58	my request is now an order.
03:18	[coughing]
03:23	this should bring your fever down.
03:26	you know what i love about appa the most?
03:29	his sense of humor.
03:31	that's nice.
03:32	i'll tell him.
03:34	ha ha ha!
03:36	classic appa.
03:37	how's sokka doing?
03:38	not so good.
03:40	being out in that storm
03:41	really did a number on him.
03:42	[shivering]
03:45	i couldn't find any ginger root for the tea,
03:48	but i found a map.
03:49	there's an herbalist institute
03:51	on the top of that mountain.
03:53	we could probably find a cure for sokka there.
03:54	aang, he's in no condition to travel.
03:57	sokka just needs more rest.
03:59	i'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.
04:01	[coughing]
04:05	not you, too.
04:06	relax. it was just a little cough.
04:08	i'm fin--
04:09	[coughing]
04:16	that's how sokka started yesterday.
04:18	now look at him.
04:19	he thinks he's an earthbender.
04:21	take that, you rock.
04:24	a few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense, too.
04:27	i'm going to find some medicine.
04:34	uh, maybe it's safer if i go on foot.
04:37	keep an eye on them, guys.
04:41	ha ha!
04:43	you guys are killing me.
04:57	we haven't been able to pick up the avatar's trail since the storm,
05:00	but if we continue heading northeast...
05:05	what do they want?
05:06	perhaps a sporting game of pai sho.
05:14	the hunt for the avatar
05:16	has been given prime importance.
05:18	all information regarding the avatar
05:19	must be reported directly to admiral zhao.
05:22	zhao has been promoted?
05:24	well, good for him.
05:27	i've got nothing to report to zhao.
05:29	now get off my ship and let us pass.
05:32	admiral zhao is not allowing ships
05:34	in or out of this area.
05:36	off my ship!
05:38	excellent.
05:40	i take the pot.
05:43	but you're all improving.
05:45	i'm certain you will win if we play again.
05:54	it says here that the avatar can create tornados
05:57	and run faster than the wind.
05:59	pretty amazing.
06:01	aw, that's just a bunch of fire lord propaganda.
06:03	there's no way that's true.
06:13	[blows horn]
06:20	katara, please, water.
06:23	listen carefully, momo.
06:26	i need you to take this to the river and fill it with water.
06:31	[hearing gibberish]
06:35	got it?
06:56	hello. i'm sorry to barge in like this,
06:58	but i need some medicine for my friends.
07:00	they have fevers and they've been coughing--
07:01	settle down, young man.
07:03	your friends are going to be fine.
07:07	i've been up here for over 40 years, you know.
07:11	used to be others, but they all left years ago.
07:14	now it's just me and miyuki.
07:18	that's nice.
07:20	wounded earth kingdom troops still come by now and again.
07:23	brave boys,
07:25	and thanks to my remedies,
07:27	they always leave in better shape than when they arrived.
07:31	that's nice. are you almost done?
07:33	hold on.
07:34	i just need to add one last ingredient.
07:37	oh, sandalwood?
07:40	oh, yes-- no, that won't do.
07:42	banana leaf? eh, nope.
07:44	ginger root?
07:46	uh-uh.
07:47	oh, where is that pesky little plant?
07:56	is everything ok?
07:58	it's been almost an hour
08:01	and you haven't given the men an order.
08:03	i don't care what they do.
08:05	don't give up hope yet.
08:07	you can still find the avatar before zhao.
08:09	how, uncle?
08:11	with zhao's resources,
08:12	it's just a matter of time
08:14	before he captures the avatar.
08:15	my honor, my throne, my country--
08:19	i'm about to lose them all.
08:23	oh, here's what i was looking for.
08:26	plum blossom.
08:29	finally. thanks for all your help.
08:31	hands off.
08:33	what do you think you're doing?
08:34	taking the cure to my friends.
08:36	oh! ha ha! this isn't a cure.
08:39	it's miyuki's dinner.
08:41	plum blossom is her favorite.
08:43	what about my friends?
08:45	well, all they need is some frozen wood frogs.
08:49	there's plenty of them down in the valley swamp.
08:51	what am i supposed to do with frozen frogs?
08:54	why, suck on them, of course.
08:56	suck on them?
08:57	the frog skin excretes a substance
09:00	that'll cure your friends,
09:02	but make sure you get plenty.
09:04	once those little critters thaw out,
09:06	they're useless.
09:09	you're insane, aren't you?
09:10	that's right.
09:13	well, don't stand there all day.
09:16	go!
09:20	uh! whoa!
09:34	uh, i think you dropped this.
09:57	aah!
10:29	a frog!
11:10	so this is the great avatar,
11:13	master of all the elements.
11:16	i don't know how you've managed to elude
11:19	the fire nation for 100 years,
11:21	but your little game of hide and seek is over.
11:25	i've never hidden from you.
11:27	untie me and i'll fight you right now.
11:29	uh, no.
11:32	tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left?
11:36	do you miss your people?
11:39	oh, don't worry.
11:41	you won't be killed like they were.
11:43	see, if you die, you'll just be reborn
11:46	and the fire nation will have to begin
11:47	its search for the avatar all over again.
11:50	so i'll keep you alive, but just barely.
12:00	blow all the wind you want.
12:02	your situation is futile.
12:05	there is no escaping this fortress
12:07	and no one is coming to rescue you.
12:15	[coughing]
12:17	water.
12:19	momo should be back any minute.
12:27	no, momo.
12:28	water.
12:30	wa-ter.
12:34	aang, what in the world is taking you so long?
13:12	all clear.
13:25	all clear.
13:26	go on in.
13:48	we are the sons and daughters of fire, the superior element,
13:53	until today, only one thing stood in our path to victory--
13:58	the avatar!
14:00	i am here to tell you that he is now my prisoner!
14:04	[cheering]
14:07	this is the year sozen's comet returns to grant us its power!
14:12	[crowd cheering]
14:13	this is the year the fire nation
14:16	breaks through the walls of ba sing se,
14:19	and burns the city to the ground.
14:22	[cheering]
14:40	what? no!
14:42	don't leave, frogs. my friends are sick and they need you.
14:45	please go back to being frozen.
14:52	[ribbit ribbit]
15:07	[punches being thrown]
15:32	[punches being thrown]
15:43	aah!
15:49	aah!
16:01	who are you? what's going on?
16:04	are you here to rescue me?
16:08	i'll take that as a yes.
16:15	my frogs!
16:17	come back!
16:18	and stop thawing out!
16:21	wait!
16:22	my friends need to suck on those frogs!
16:30	how many times do i have to tell you, momo?
16:33	we need water.
16:35	wa-ter.
16:38	oh, forget it.
16:40	aang, please hurry.
16:43	who is this aang kid you keep talking about, your highness?
17:13	i want a full transcription of my speech
17:16	sent to the fire lord,
17:17	along with glowing testimonials
17:20	from all of the ranking officers present, and--
17:22	[men grunting]
17:29	[ribbit]
17:33	sir, shall i hold off sending that speech to the fire lord?
17:42	[noisy chimes ringing]
17:45	there. on the wall!
17:47	aah!
17:54	the avatar has escaped!
17:57	close all the gates immediately.
17:59	stay close to me.
18:47	aah!
19:00	aah!
19:22	[yells]
19:25	take this.
19:27	jump on my back!
19:35	give me the next one!
19:54	hold your fire!
19:56	the avatar must be captured alive.
20:05	open the gate.
20:07	admiral, what are you doing?
20:08	let them out.
20:10	now!
20:14	how could you let them go?
20:16	a situation like this requires...precision.
20:34	do you have a clear shot?
20:38	knock out the thief.
20:41	i'll deliver him to the fire lord along with the avatar.
20:59	quick!
21:00	recover the avatar!
21:26	[ribbit]
21:45	you know what the worst part
21:47	about being born over 100 years ago is?
21:49	i miss all the friends i used to hang out with.
21:52	before the war started,
21:53	i used to always visit my friend, kuzon.
21:56	the two of us, we'd get in and out
21:58	of so much trouble together.
22:00	he was one of the best friends i ever had...
22:03	and he was from the fire nation, just like you.
22:06	if we knew each other back then,
22:08	do you think we could have been friends, too?
22:32	where have you been, prince zuko?
22:34	you missed music night.
22:36	lieutenant jee sang a stirring love song.
22:40	i'm going to bed.
22:42	no disturbances.
22:46	[playing instrument]
22:54	suck on these.
22:56	it'll make you feel better.
23:00	aang, how was your trip?
23:03	did you make any new friends?
23:05	no.
23:06	i don't think i did.
23:24	mm!
23:25	this is tasty.
23:27	mm, mm!
23:28	[ribbit]
23:30	ptooey!
23:31	aah!
