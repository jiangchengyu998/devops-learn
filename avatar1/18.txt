00:10	Katara: WATER...
00:11	EARTH...
00:13	FIRE...
00:15	AIR.
00:17	LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.
00:22	THEN, EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.
00:26	ONLY THE AVATAR, MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,
00:29	COULD STOP THEM.
00:30	BUT WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED HIM MOST,
00:32	HE VANISHED.
00:33	100 YEARS PASSED,
00:35	AND MY BROTHER AND I DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR--
00:38	AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG.
00:39	AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING SKILLS ARE GREAT,
00:41	HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN BEFORE HE'S READY TO SAVE ANYONE.
00:44	Aang: OOF.
00:46	BUT I BELIEVE AANG CAN SAVE THE WORLD.
00:57	WELL, IF WE GO TO THE NORTH POLE,
00:59	YOU CAN MASTER WATERBENDING.
01:01	WE CAN LEARN IT TOGETHER!
01:03	Jeong Jeong: YOU HAVE HEALING ABILITIES.
01:05	THE GREAT BENDERS OF THE WATER TRIBE
01:07	SOMETIMES HAVE THIS ABILITY.
01:09	ALL INFORMATION REGARDING THE AVATAR
01:11	MUST BE REPORTED DIRECTLY TO ADMIRAL ZHAO.
01:13	WITH ZHAO'S RESOURCES,
01:15	IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE CATCHES THE AVATAR.
01:18	MY HONOR, MY THRONE, MY COUNTRY,
01:21	I'M ABOUT TO LOSE THEM ALL.
01:31	[COOING]
01:32	[LOWING]
01:35	I'M NOT ONE TO COMPLAIN,
01:36	BUT CAN'T APPA FLY ANY HIGHER?
01:41	I HAVE AN IDEA.
01:42	WHY DON'T WE ALL GET ON YOUR BACK,
01:44	AND YOU CAN FLY US TO THE NORTH POLE.
01:46	I'D LOVE TO.
01:47	CLIMB ON, EVERYONE.
01:49	SOKKA IS READY FOR TAKEOFF.
01:53	LOOK, WE'RE ALL JUST A LITTLE TIRED AND CRANKY
01:56	BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN FLYING FOR TWO DAYS STRAIGHT.
01:58	AND FOR WHAT?
02:00	WE CAN'T EVEN FIND THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE.
02:01	THERE'S NOTHING UP HERE.
02:04	[SPLASH]
02:06	AAGH!
02:09	[KIDS SCREAMING]
02:21	THEY'RE WATER BENDERS.
02:22	WE FOUND THE WATER TRIBE.
02:28	Zhao: HE'S HEADING NORTH.
02:29	THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE.
02:32	THE AVATAR NEEDS TO MASTER WATERBENDING.
02:35	HE LOOKING FOR A TEACHER.
02:37	THEN WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? LET'S GO GET HIM.
02:40	PATIENCE, CAPTAIN LI.
02:42	THIS ISN'T SOME LITTLE EARTH VILLAGE
02:44	WE CAN JUST MARCH INTO.
02:45	THE WATER TRIBE IS A GREAT NATION.
02:48	THERE'S A REASON THEY'VE SURVIVED
02:50	100 YEARS OF WAR.
02:51	THE FROZEN TUNDRA IS TREACHEROUS.
02:53	THE LANDSCAPE ITSELF IS AN ICY FORTRESS.
02:56	WE'LL NEED A MASSIVE INVASION FORCE.
03:02	Aang: THERE IT IS!
03:04	Katara: THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE.
03:08	WE'RE FINALLY HERE.
03:09	[MOMO COOS]
03:30	Katara: I CAN'T BELIEVE
03:32	HOW MANY WATERBENDERS LIVE UP HERE.
03:34	WE'LL FIND A MASTER TO TEACH US NO PROBLEM.
04:17	Katara: THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL.
04:19	YEAH.
04:20	SHE IS.

05:18	TONIGHT, WE CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL
05:21	OF OUR BROTHER AND SISTER
05:23	FROM THE SOUTHERN TRIBE.
05:25	AND THEY HAVE BROUGHT WITH THEM SOMEONE VERY SPECIAL,
05:29	SOMEONE WHO MANY OF US BELIEVED
05:31	DISAPPEARED FROM THE WORLD UNTIL NOW...
05:34	THE AVATAR.
05:36	[CHEERING]
05:39	WE ALSO CELEBRATE MY DAUGHTER'S 16th BIRTHDAY.
05:44	PRINCESS YUE IS NOW OF MARRYING AGE.
05:49	THANK YOU, FATHER.
05:50	MAY THE GREAT OCEAN AND MOON SPIRITS
05:52	WATCH OVER US DURING THESE TROUBLED TIMES.
05:55	NOW, MASTER PAKKU AND HIS STUDENTS WILL PERFORM!
06:04	[APPLAUSE]
06:19	HI THERE.
06:21	SOKKA, SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE.
06:22	VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
06:25	SO, UH...
06:28	YOU'RE A PRINCESS, HUH?!
06:31	YOU KNOW, BACK IN MY TRIBE,
06:32	I'M KIND OF LIKE A PRINCE MYSELF.
06:34	HA! THE PRINCE OF WHAT?!
06:36	A LOT OF THINGS!
06:37	DO YOU MIND?
06:39	I'M TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION HERE.
06:40	MY APOLOGIES, PRINCE SOKKA.
06:44	SO, IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA BE IN TOWN FOR A WHILE.
06:47	I'M THINKING MAYBE WE COULD...
06:49	DO AN ACTIVITY TOGETHER?
06:52	DO AN ACTIVITY?!
06:56	[COUGHS]
06:58	VERY SMOOTH.
07:00	MASTER PAKKU,
07:01	MEET YOUR NEWEST STUDENT:
07:03	THE AVATAR.
07:05	JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE DESTINED TO SAVE THE WORLD,
07:07	DON'T EXPECT ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT.
07:10	MY FRIEND AND I CAN'T WAIT
07:12	TO START TRAINING WITH YOU...
07:14	AFTER WE RELAX FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
07:16	IF YOU WANT TO RELAX,
07:18	THEN I SUGGEST VISITING A TROPICAL ISLAND.
07:20	IF NOT, I'LL SEE YOU BOTH AT SUNRISE.
07:23	GOOD NIGHT.
07:30	FOR THE LAST TIME,
07:31	I'M NOT PLAYING THE SUNGI HORN.
07:33	NO, IT'S ABOUT OUR PLANS.
07:35	THERE IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM.
07:41	I'M TAKING YOUR CREW.
07:42	WHAT?!
07:44	I'VE RECRUITED THEM FOR A LITTLE EXPEDITION
07:45	TO THE NORTH POLE.
07:47	UNCLE, IS THAT TRUE?
07:48	I'M AFRAID SO.
07:50	HE'S TAKING EVERYONE--
07:52	EVEN THE COOK.
07:54	SORRY YOU WON'T BE THERE
07:55	TO WATCH ME CAPTURE THE AVATAR,
07:57	BUT I CAN'T HAVE YOU GETTING IN MY WAY AGAIN.
08:00	[GROWLS]
08:01	NO!
08:19	I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SKILLED
08:21	WITH BROADSWORDS, PRINCE ZUKO.
08:23	I'M NOT.
08:24	THEY'RE ANTIQUES.
08:26	JUST DECORATIVE.
08:28	HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE BLUE SPIRIT, GENERAL IROH?
08:31	JUST RUMORS.
08:32	I DON'T THINK HE IS REAL.
08:34	HE'S REAL, ALL RIGHT.
08:35	HE'S A CRIMINAL
08:37	AND AN ENEMY OF THE FIRE NATION.
08:39	BUT I HAVE A FEELING JUSTICE
08:41	WILL CATCH UP WITH HIM SOON.
08:43	GENERAL IROH, THE OFFER TO JOIN MY MISSION
08:44	STILL STANDS...
08:46	IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.
08:53	I'VE WAITED FOR THIS DAY MY WHOLE LIFE.
08:55	I FINALLY GET TO LEARN FROM
08:57	A REAL WATERBENDING MASTER!
09:02	Aang: GOOD MORNING, MASTER PAKKU!
09:04	NO, PLEASE! MARCH RIGHT IN!
09:06	I'M NOT CONCENTRATING OR ANYTHING.
09:08	UH, THIS IS MY FRIEND--KATARA...
09:10	THE ONE I TOLD YOU ABOUT.
09:13	I'M SORRY.
09:15	I THINK THERE'S BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING.
09:16	YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOUR FRIEND WAS A GIRL.
09:19	IN OUR TRIBE, IT IS FORBIDDEN
09:21	FOR WOMEN TO LEARN WATERBENDING.
09:32	WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU WON'T TEACH ME?!
09:34	I DIDN'T TRAVEL ACROSS THE ENTIRE WORLD
09:36	SO YOU COULD TELL ME NO!
09:38	NO.
09:40	BUT THERE MUST BE OTHER FEMALE WATERBENDERS
09:41	IN YOUR TRIBE.
09:42	HERE, THE WOMEN LEARN FROM YAGODA
09:44	TO USE THEIR WATERBENDING TO HEAL.
09:46	I'M SURE SHE WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOU
09:48	AS HER STUDENT--
09:50	DESPITE YOUR BAD ATTITUDE.
09:52	I DON'T WANT TO HEAL. I WANT TO FIGHT!
09:54	I CAN SEE THAT.
09:55	BUT OUR TRIBE HAS CUSTOMS, RULES.
09:58	WELL, YOUR RULES STINK!
09:59	YEAH!
10:00	THEY'RE NOT FAIR.
10:02	IF YOU WON'T TEACH KATARA, THEN--
10:03	THEN WHAT?!
10:05	THEN I WON'T LEARN FROM YOU!
10:07	WELL, HAVE FUN TEACHING YOURSELF.
10:09	I'M SURE YOU'LL DO A GREAT JOB.
10:11	WAIT!
10:12	AANG DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
10:14	YOU CAN'T RISK YOUR TRAINING FOR ME.
10:17	YOU HAVE TO LEARN FROM MASTER PAKKU,
10:19	EVEN IF HE IS A BIG JERK.
10:25	WHY DON'T WE GET STARTED, THEN.
10:29	Sokka: PRINCESS YUE, GOOD MORNING!
10:32	[PANTING]
10:33	HEY, HOW ABOUT THAT PICNIC LAST NIGHT?
10:35	BOY, YOUR DAD SURE KNOWS HOW TO THROW A PARTY.
10:38	I'M HAPPY YOU ENJOYED YOURSELF.
10:40	WELL, IT WASN'T AS MUCH FUN AFTER YOU LEFT.
10:44	SO, I'M STILL HOPING
10:46	WE CAN SEE MORE OF EACH OTHER.
10:47	DO AN ACTIVITY, YOU MEAN?
10:49	YES, AT A PLACE...
10:52	FOR SOME TIME.
10:53	I'D LOVE TO.
10:55	I'LL MEET YOU ON THAT BRIDGE TONIGHT.
10:57	GREAT! I'LL SEE YOU--
10:59	AAGH!
11:00	[GIGGLES]
11:01	SORRY.
11:02	THAT'S OK.
11:04	IT WAS WORTH IT.
11:05	SEE YOU TONIGHT.
11:08	Zhao: I'M VERY IMPRESSED.
11:10	YOU ALL SEEM HIGHLY QUALIFIED
11:13	FOR THE MISSION I HAVE IN MIND.
11:15	[SQUAWKING]
11:17	THAT'S SOME TASTY GOLD.
11:20	WHAT DO YOU NEED US TO DO?
11:22	I BELIEVE YOU'RE ACQUAINTED
11:24	WITH PRINCE ZUKO.
11:32	UM, HI.
11:35	ARE YOU YAGODA?
11:36	ARE YOU HERE FOR THE HEALING LESSON?
11:42	I GUESS I AM.
11:44	WELCOME!
11:45	WELCOME!
11:52	YOU'RE MOVING THE WATER AROUND,
11:55	BUT YOU'RE NOT FEELING THE PUSH AND PULL.
11:57	I'M TRYING.
12:00	[SLURP]
12:02	AHH!
12:03	MAYBE THAT MOVE IS TOO ADVANCED FOR YOU.
12:05	WHY DON'T YOU TRY AN EASIER ONE?
12:07	[GROWLS]
12:12	THANKS FOR THE LESSON.
12:14	SO, WHO'S THE LUCKY BOY?
12:15	HUH?
12:17	YOUR BETROTHAL NECKLACE.
12:19	YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED, RIGHT?
12:20	OH, NO.
12:22	I DON'T THINK I'M READY FOR THAT YET.
12:24	MY GRANDMOTHER GAVE MY MOTHER THIS NECKLACE,
12:27	AND MY MOTHER PASSED IT DOWN TO ME.
12:29	I RECOGNIZE THIS CARVING!
12:32	I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T REALIZE SOONER.
12:35	YOU'RE THE SPITTING IMAGE OF KANNA.
12:37	WAIT!
12:39	HOW DO YOU KNOW MY GRAN-GRAN'S NAME?
12:41	WHEN I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE,
12:43	I WAS FRIENDS WITH KANNA.
12:45	SHE WAS BORN HERE--
12:46	IN THE NORTHERN TRIBE.
12:48	SHE NEVER TOLD ME.
12:50	YOUR GRANDMOTHER HAD AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE
12:52	WITH A YOUNG WATERBENDER.
12:54	HE CARVED THAT NECKLACE FOR HER.
12:56	IF GRAN-GRAN WAS ENGAGED, WHY DID SHE LEAVE?
12:59	I DON'T KNOW.
13:01	THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A MYSTERY TO ME.
13:03	SHE LEFT WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.
13:06	Iroh: GOOD LUCK!
13:10	THE CREW WANTED ME TO WISH YOU SAFE TRAVELS.
13:13	GOOD RIDDANCE TO THOSE TRAITORS.
13:15	IT'S A LOVELY NIGHT FOR A WALK.
13:17	WHY DON'T YOU JOIN ME?
13:19	IT WOULD CLEAR YOUR HEAD.
13:23	OR JUST STAY IN YOUR ROOM
13:25	AND SIT IN THE DARK.
13:27	WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY.
13:29	[DOOR CLOSES]
13:31	[HUMMING]
13:55	WHOA!
13:57	CAREFUL WITH THE BLASTING JELLY.
14:02	[SQUEAK] OOH!
14:04	UNCLE?
14:05	UNCLE, IS THAT YOU?
14:29	[SQUAWK]
14:37	AAH!
14:41	[ZUKO SCREAMING]
14:49	ZUKO!
14:58	ZUKO.
15:11	HI, PRINCESS YUE.
15:13	I MADE YOU SOMETHING.
15:15	I CARVED IT MYSELF.
15:17	IT'S A BEAR.
15:18	ACTUALLY, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A FISH.
15:21	SEE, IT HAS A FIN.
15:23	OH.
15:25	I'M SORRY. I MADE A MISTAKE.
15:28	I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU TO COME HERE.
15:35	[GRUNTS]
15:38	Katara: HOW'S WARRIOR TRAINING GOING?
15:40	[GROWLS]
15:42	THAT BAD?
15:43	NO, IT'S PRINCESS YUE.
15:45	I DON'T GET IT.
15:46	ONE MINUTE, SHE WANTS TO GO OUT WITH ME,
15:48	AND THE NEXT, SHE'S TELLING ME TO GET LOST.
15:50	SO, HOW'S WATERBENDING TRAINING?
15:52	MASTER POOP-HEAD WON'T TEACH HER
15:54	BECAUSE SHE'S A GIRL.
15:56	WHY DON'T YOU JUST TEACH HER, AANG?
15:59	WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?!
16:01	AT NIGHT, YOU CAN TEACH ME
16:03	WHATEVER MOVES YOU LEARN FROM MASTER PAKKU.
16:04	THAT WAY, YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO PRACTICE WITH,
16:06	AND I GET TO LEARN WATERBENDING.
16:08	EVERYONE'S HAPPY!
16:09	I'M NOT HAPPY.
16:11	BUT YOU'RE NEVER HAPPY.
16:12	COME ON, AANG.
16:19	MASTER PAKKU SAID THIS MOVE
16:20	IS ALL ABOUT SINKING AND FLOATING.
16:25	I GOT IT!
16:28	THAT WAS AMAZING!
16:30	THAT WASN'T ME.
16:33	I WAS JUST SHOWING KATARA A FEW MOVES.
16:36	YOU HAVE DISRESPECTED ME,
16:37	MY TEACHINGS, AND MY ENTIRE CULTURE.
16:40	I'M SORRY, I--
16:41	YOU ARE NO LONGER WELCOME AS MY STUDENT.
16:52	WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
16:54	FORCE MASTER PAKKU TO TAKE AANG BACK
16:56	AS HIS STUDENT?
16:57	YES. PLEASE.
17:00	I SUSPECT HE MIGHT CHANGE HIS MIND
17:02	IF YOU SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND APOLOGIZE TO HIM.
17:09	FINE.
17:11	I'M WAITING, LITTLE GIRL.
17:13	NO!
17:15	NO WAY AM I APOLOGIZING
17:17	TO A SOUR OLD MAN LIKE YOU!
17:20	Aang: UH, KATARA...
17:22	I'LL BE OUTSIDE
17:24	IF YOU'RE MAN ENOUGH TO FIGHT ME.
17:29	I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
17:30	YEAH, I THINK SHE DID.
17:34	I'M DEVASTATED TO HEAR ABOUT PRINCE ZUKO.
17:37	JUST DEVASTATED.
17:40	THE FIRE LORD WILL NOT BE PLEASED
17:42	WHEN HE LEARNS WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE.
17:45	YOU KNOW WHO WAS BEHIND THE ATTACK?
17:48	YES. PIRATES.
17:51	WE HAD A RUN-IN WITH THEM A WHILE BACK.
17:54	THEY WANTED REVENGE.
17:58	SO, HAVE YOU RECONSIDERED MY OFFER?
18:01	YES, I ACCEPT.
18:03	IT WILL BE AN HONOR TO SERVE AS YOUR GENERAL.
18:07	TO THE FIRE NATION.
18:09	TO VICTORY!
18:14	Sokka: ARE YOU CRAZY, KATARA?
18:15	YOU'RE NOT GONNA WIN THIS FIGHT.
18:17	I KNOW. I DON'T CARE.
18:19	YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS FOR ME.
18:21	I CAN FIND ANOTHER TEACHER.
18:22	I'M NOT DOING IT FOR YOU.
18:24	SOMEONE NEEDS TO SLAP SOME SENSE INTO THAT GUY.
18:27	SO, YOU DECIDED TO SHOW UP?
18:33	AREN'T YOU GONNA FIGHT?
18:34	GO BACK TO THE HEALING HUTS
18:36	WITH THE OTHER WOMEN, WHERE YOU BELONG.
18:42	FINE.
18:44	YOU WANT TO LEARN TO FIGHT SO BAD,
18:45	STUDY CLOSELY.
18:57	DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.
19:02	OW!
19:18	YOU CAN'T KNOCK ME DOWN!
19:20	Aang: GO, KATARA!
19:22	[CHEERING]
19:31	[CHEERING]
19:53	[PANTING]
20:02	WELL, I'M IMPRESSED.
20:05	YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT WATERBENDER.
20:08	BUT YOU STILL WON'T TEACH ME, WILL YOU?
20:10	NO.
20:21	[PANTING]
20:35	THIS FIGHT IS OVER.
20:37	COME BACK HERE. I'M NOT FINISHED YET.
20:40	YES. YOU ARE.
20:43	THIS IS MY NECKLACE.
20:47	NO, IT'S NOT. IT'S MINE. GIVE IT BACK!
20:50	I MADE THIS 60 YEARS AGO...
20:52	FOR THE LOVE OF MY LIFE--
20:54	FOR KANNA.
20:56	MY GRAN-GRAN WAS SUPPOSED TO MARRY YOU?
21:05	OUR PLAN IS WORKING PERFECTLY.
21:07	ZHAO DOESN'T SUSPECT A THING.
21:10	YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
21:12	NO NEPHEW OF MINE
21:14	IS GOING TO STOW AWAY ON A SHIP
21:15	WITHOUT SOME BACKUP.
21:17	THANK YOU, UNCLE.
21:18	[DOOR OPENS]
21:19	SOMEONE'S COMING.
21:21	STAY HIDDEN UNTIL WE GET TO THE NORTH POLE
21:24	AND THE AVATAR WILL BE YOURS.
21:26	GOOD LUCK.
21:31	I CARVED THIS NECKLACE FOR YOUR GRANDMOTHER
21:32	WHEN WE GOT ENGAGED.
21:34	I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A LONG HAPPY LIFE TOGETHER.
21:38	I LOVED HER.
21:40	BUT SHE DIDN'T LOVE YOU, DID SHE?
21:42	IT WAS AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE.
21:45	GRAN-GRAN WOULDN'T LET YOUR TRIBE'S
21:47	STUPID CUSTOMS RUN HER LIFE.
21:49	THAT'S WHY SHE LEFT.
21:50	IT MUST HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF COURAGE.
21:53	[SOBBING]
21:55	GO GET HER.
22:04	WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
22:06	NOTHING.
22:07	I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
22:09	I THINK YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
22:10	AND I NEVER THOUGHT A GIRL LIKE YOU
22:12	WOULD EVEN NOTICE A GUY LIKE ME.
22:13	YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
22:15	NO, NO.
22:16	SEE, THAT'S THE THING.
22:18	I THINK I DO UNDERSTAND NOW.
22:19	YOU'RE A PRINCESS, AND I'M...
22:22	I'M JUST A SOUTHERN PEASANT.
22:23	NO, SOKKA.
22:25	IT'S OK.
22:27	YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.
22:28	I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, OK.
22:34	OK, NOW I'M REALLY CONFUSED!
22:36	HAPPY, BUT CONFUSED.
22:40	I DO LIKE YOU--A LOT!
22:42	BUT WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER.
22:44	AND NOT FOR THE REASON YOU THINK.
22:46	IT'S BECAUSE...
22:49	I'M ENGAGED.
22:52	I'M SORRY.
23:03	NOT BAD. NOT BAD.
23:05	HA HA HA HA.
23:06	KEEP PRACTICING, AND MAYBE YOU'LL GET IT
23:08	BY THE TIME YOU'RE MY AGE.
23:11	[PANTING]
23:12	HEY, KATARA.
23:14	WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
23:16	IT'S PAST SUNRISE.
23:18	YOU'RE LATE.
23:20	GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE.
23:21	YOU, TOO.
23:30	MY FLEET IS READY.
23:33	SET A COURSE FOR THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE.
