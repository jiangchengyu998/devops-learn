00:10	katara: water...
00:11	earth...
00:13	fire...
00:15	air.
00:17	long ago, the 4 nations lived together in harmony.
00:22	then, everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
00:26	only the avatar, master of all 4 elements,
00:29	could stop them.
00:30	but when the world needed him most,
00:32	he vanished.
00:33	100 years passed,
00:35	and my brother and i discovered the new avatar--
00:38	an airbender named aang.
00:39	and although his airbending skills are great,
00:41	he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
00:44	aang: oof.
00:46	but i believe aang can save the world.
00:57	well, if we go to the north pole,
00:59	you can master waterbending.
01:01	we can learn it together!
01:03	jeong jeong: you have healing abilities.
01:05	the great benders of the water tribe
01:07	sometimes have this ability.
01:09	all information regarding the avatar
01:11	must be reported directly to admiral zhao.
01:13	with zhao's resources,
01:15	it's just a matter of time before he catches the avatar.
01:18	my honor, my throne, my country,
01:21	i'm about to lose them all.
01:31	[cooing]
01:32	[lowing]
01:35	i'm not one to complain,
01:36	but can't appa fly any higher?
01:41	i have an idea.
01:42	why don't we all get on your back,
01:44	and you can fly us to the north pole.
01:46	i'd love to.
01:47	climb on, everyone.
01:49	sokka is ready for takeoff.
01:53	look, we're all just a little tired and cranky
01:56	because we've been flying for two days straight.
01:58	and for what?
02:00	we can't even find the northern water tribe.
02:01	there's nothing up here.
02:04	[splash]
02:06	aagh!
02:09	[kids screaming]
02:21	they're water benders.
02:22	we found the water tribe.
02:28	zhao: he's heading north.
02:29	the northern water tribe.
02:32	the avatar needs to master waterbending.
02:35	he looking for a teacher.
02:37	then what are we waiting for? let's go get him.
02:40	patience, captain li.
02:42	this isn't some little earth village
02:44	we can just march into.
02:45	the water tribe is a great nation.
02:48	there's a reason they've survived
02:50	100 years of war.
02:51	the frozen tundra is treacherous.
02:53	the landscape itself is an icy fortress.
02:56	we'll need a massive invasion force.
03:02	aang: there it is!
03:04	katara: the northern water tribe.
03:08	we're finally here.
03:09	[momo coos]
03:30	katara: i can't believe
03:32	how many waterbenders live up here.
03:34	we'll find a master to teach us no problem.
04:17	katara: this place is beautiful.
04:19	yeah.
04:20	she is.

05:11	[screams]
05:18	tonight, we celebrate the arrival
05:21	of our brother and sister
05:23	from the southern tribe.
05:25	and they have brought with them someone very special,
05:29	someone who many of us believed
05:31	disappeared from the world until now...
05:34	the avatar.
05:36	[cheering]
05:39	we also celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday.
05:44	princess yue is now of marrying age.
05:49	thank you, father.
05:50	may the great ocean and moon spirits
05:52	watch over us during these troubled times.
05:55	now, master pakku and his students will perform!
06:04	[applause]
06:19	hi there.
06:21	sokka, southern water tribe.
06:22	very nice to meet you.
06:25	so, uh...
06:28	you're a princess, huh?!
06:31	you know, back in my tribe,
06:32	i'm kind of like a prince myself.
06:34	ha! the prince of what?!
06:36	a lot of things!
06:37	do you mind?
06:39	i'm trying to have a conversation here.
06:40	my apologies, prince sokka.
06:44	so, it looks like i'm gonna be in town for a while.
06:47	i'm thinking maybe we could...
06:49	do an activity together?
06:52	do an activity?!
06:56	[coughs]
06:58	very smooth.
07:00	master pakku,
07:01	meet your newest student:
07:03	the avatar.
07:05	just because you're destined to save the world,
07:07	don't expect any special treatment.
07:10	my friend and i can't wait
07:12	to start training with you...
07:14	after we relax for a couple of days.
07:16	if you want to relax,
07:18	then i suggest visiting a tropical island.
07:20	if not, i'll see you both at sunrise.
07:23	good night.
07:30	for the last time,
07:31	i'm not playing the sungi horn.
07:33	no, it's about our plans.
07:35	there is a bit of a problem.
07:41	i'm taking your crew.
07:42	what?!
07:44	i've recruited them for a little expedition
07:45	to the north pole.
07:47	uncle, is that true?
07:48	i'm afraid so.
07:50	he's taking everyone--
07:52	even the cook.
07:54	sorry you won't be there
07:55	to watch me capture the avatar,
07:57	but i can't have you getting in my way again.
08:00	[growls]
08:01	no!
08:19	i didn't know you were skilled
08:21	with broadswords, prince zuko.
08:23	i'm not.
08:24	they're antiques.
08:26	just decorative.
08:28	have you heard of the blue spirit, general iroh?
08:31	just rumors.
08:32	i don't think he is real.
08:34	he's real, all right.
08:35	he's a criminal
08:37	and an enemy of the fire nation.
08:39	but i have a feeling justice
08:41	will catch up with him soon.
08:43	general iroh, the offer to join my mission
08:44	still stands...
08:46	if you change your mind.
08:53	i've waited for this day my whole life.
08:55	i finally get to learn from
08:57	a real waterbending master!
09:02	aang: good morning, master pakku!
09:04	no, please! march right in!
09:06	i'm not concentrating or anything.
09:08	uh, this is my friend--katara...
09:10	the one i told you about.
09:13	i'm sorry.
09:15	i think there's been a misunderstanding.
09:16	you didn't tell me your friend was a girl.
09:19	in our tribe, it is forbidden
09:21	for women to learn waterbending.
09:32	what do you mean, you won't teach me?!
09:34	i didn't travel across the entire world
09:36	so you could tell me no!
09:38	no.
09:40	but there must be other female waterbenders
09:41	in your tribe.
09:42	here, the women learn from yagoda
09:44	to use their waterbending to heal.
09:46	i'm sure she would be happy to take you
09:48	as her student--
09:50	despite your bad attitude.
09:52	i don't want to heal. i want to fight!
09:54	i can see that.
09:55	but our tribe has customs, rules.
09:58	well, your rules stink!
09:59	yeah!
10:00	they're not fair.
10:02	if you won't teach katara, then--
10:03	then what?!
10:05	then i won't learn from you!
10:07	well, have fun teaching yourself.
10:09	i'm sure you'll do a great job.
10:11	wait!
10:12	aang didn't mean that.
10:14	you can't risk your training for me.
10:17	you have to learn from master pakku,
10:19	even if he is a big jerk.
10:25	why don't we get started, then.
10:29	sokka: princess yue, good morning!
10:32	[panting]
10:33	hey, how about that picnic last night?
10:35	boy, your dad sure knows how to throw a party.
10:38	i'm happy you enjoyed yourself.
10:40	well, it wasn't as much fun after you left.
10:44	so, i'm still hoping
10:46	we can see more of each other.
10:47	do an activity, you mean?
10:49	yes, at a place...
10:52	for some time.
10:53	i'd love to.
10:55	i'll meet you on that bridge tonight.
10:57	great! i'll see you--
10:59	aagh!
11:00	[giggles]
11:01	sorry.
11:02	that's ok.
11:04	it was worth it.
11:05	see you tonight.
11:08	zhao: i'm very impressed.
11:10	you all seem highly qualified
11:13	for the mission i have in mind.
11:15	[squawking]
11:17	that's some tasty gold.
11:20	what do you need us to do?
11:22	i believe you're acquainted
11:24	with prince zuko.
11:32	um, hi.
11:35	are you yagoda?
11:36	are you here for the healing lesson?
11:42	i guess i am.
11:44	welcome!
11:45	welcome!
11:52	you're moving the water around,
11:55	but you're not feeling the push and pull.
11:57	i'm trying.
12:00	[slurp]
12:02	ahh!
12:03	maybe that move is too advanced for you.
12:05	why don't you try an easier one?
12:07	[growls]
12:12	thanks for the lesson.
12:14	so, who's the lucky boy?
12:15	huh?
12:17	your betrothal necklace.
12:19	you're getting married, right?
12:20	oh, no.
12:22	i don't think i'm ready for that yet.
12:24	my grandmother gave my mother this necklace,
12:27	and my mother passed it down to me.
12:29	i recognize this carving!
12:32	i don't know why i didn't realize sooner.
12:35	you're the spitting image of kanna.
12:37	wait!
12:39	how do you know my gran-gran's name?
12:41	when i was about your age,
12:43	i was friends with kanna.
12:45	she was born here--
12:46	in the northern tribe.
12:48	she never told me.
12:50	your grandmother had an arranged marriage
12:52	with a young waterbender.
12:54	he carved that necklace for her.
12:56	if gran-gran was engaged, why did she leave?
12:59	i don't know.
13:01	that's always been a mystery to me.
13:03	she left without saying good-bye.
13:06	iroh: good luck!
13:10	the crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.
13:13	good riddance to those traitors.
13:15	it's a lovely night for a walk.
13:17	why don't you join me?
13:19	it would clear your head.
13:23	or just stay in your room
13:25	and sit in the dark.
13:27	whatever makes you happy.
13:29	[door closes]
13:31	[humming]
13:55	whoa!
13:57	careful with the blasting jelly.
14:02	[squeak] ooh!
14:04	uncle?
14:05	uncle, is that you?
14:29	[squawk]
14:37	aah!
14:41	[zuko screaming]
14:49	zuko!
14:58	zuko.
15:11	hi, princess yue.
15:13	i made you something.
15:15	i carved it myself.
15:17	it's a bear.
15:18	actually, it's supposed to be a fish.
15:21	see, it has a fin.
15:23	oh.
15:25	i'm sorry. i made a mistake.
15:28	i shouldn't have asked you to come here.
15:35	[grunts]
15:38	katara: how's warrior training going?
15:40	[growls]
15:42	that bad?
15:43	no, it's princess yue.
15:45	i don't get it.
15:46	one minute, she wants to go out with me,
15:48	and the next, she's telling me to get lost.
15:50	so, how's waterbending training?
15:52	master poop-head won't teach her
15:54	because she's a girl.
15:56	why don't you just teach her, aang?
15:59	why didn't i think of that?!
16:01	at night, you can teach me
16:03	whatever moves you learn from master pakku.
16:04	that way, you have someone to practice with,
16:06	and i get to learn waterbending.
16:08	everyone's happy!
16:09	i'm not happy.
16:11	but you're never happy.
16:12	come on, aang.
16:19	master pakku said this move
16:20	is all about sinking and floating.
16:25	i got it!
16:28	that was amazing!
16:30	that wasn't me.
16:33	i was just showing katara a few moves.
16:36	you have disrespected me,
16:37	my teachings, and my entire culture.
16:40	i'm sorry, i--
16:41	you are no longer welcome as my student.
16:52	what do you want me to do?
16:54	force master pakku to take aang back
16:56	as his student?
16:57	yes. please.
17:00	i suspect he might change his mind
17:02	if you swallow your pride and apologize to him.
17:09	fine.
17:11	i'm waiting, little girl.
17:13	no!
17:15	no way am i apologizing
17:17	to a sour old man like you!
17:20	aang: uh, katara...
17:22	i'll be outside
17:24	if you're man enough to fight me.
17:29	i'm sure she didn't mean that.
17:30	yeah, i think she did.
17:34	i'm devastated to hear about prince zuko.
17:37	just devastated.
17:40	the fire lord will not be pleased
17:42	when he learns who was responsible.
17:45	you know who was behind the attack?
17:48	yes. pirates.
17:51	we had a run-in with them a while back.
17:54	they wanted revenge.
17:58	so, have you reconsidered my offer?
18:01	yes, i accept.
18:03	it will be an honor to serve as your general.
18:07	to the fire nation.
18:09	to victory!
18:14	sokka: are you crazy, katara?
18:15	you're not gonna win this fight.
18:17	i know. i don't care.
18:19	you don't have to do this for me.
18:21	i can find another teacher.
18:22	i'm not doing it for you.
18:24	someone needs to slap some sense into that guy.
18:27	so, you decided to show up?
18:33	aren't you gonna fight?
18:34	go back to the healing huts
18:36	with the other women, where you belong.
18:42	fine.
18:44	you want to learn to fight so bad,
18:45	study closely.
18:57	don't worry. i'm not going to hurt you.
19:02	ow!
19:18	you can't knock me down!
19:20	aang: go, katara!
19:22	[cheering]
19:31	[cheering]
19:53	[panting]
20:02	well, i'm impressed.
20:05	you are an excellent waterbender.
20:08	but you still won't teach me, will you?
20:10	no.
20:21	[panting]
20:35	this fight is over.
20:37	come back here. i'm not finished yet.
20:40	yes. you are.
20:43	this is my necklace.
20:47	no, it's not. it's mine. give it back!
20:50	i made this 60 years ago...
20:52	for the love of my life--
20:54	for kanna.
20:56	my gran-gran was supposed to marry you?
21:05	our plan is working perfectly.
21:07	zhao doesn't suspect a thing.
21:10	you didn't have to do this.
21:12	no nephew of mine
21:14	is going to stow away on a ship
21:15	without some backup.
21:17	thank you, uncle.
21:18	[door opens]
21:19	someone's coming.
21:21	stay hidden until we get to the north pole
21:24	and the avatar will be yours.
21:26	good luck.
21:31	i carved this necklace for your grandmother
21:32	when we got engaged.
21:34	i thought we would have a long happy life together.
21:38	i loved her.
21:40	but she didn't love you, did she?
21:42	it was an arranged marriage.
21:45	gran-gran wouldn't let your tribe's
21:47	stupid customs run her life.
21:49	that's why she left.
21:50	it must have taken a lot of courage.
21:53	[sobbing]
21:55	go get her.
22:04	what do you want from me?
22:06	nothing.
22:07	i just want you to know
22:09	i think you're beautiful.
22:10	and i never thought a girl like you
22:12	would even notice a guy like me.
22:13	you don't understand.
22:15	no, no.
22:16	see, that's the thing.
22:18	i think i do understand now.
22:19	you're a princess, and i'm...
22:22	i'm just a southern peasant.
22:23	no, sokka.
22:25	it's ok.
22:27	you don't have to say anything.
22:28	i'll see you around, ok.
22:34	ok, now i'm really confused!
22:36	happy, but confused.
22:40	i do like you--a lot!
22:42	but we can't be together.
22:44	and not for the reason you think.
22:46	it's because...
22:49	i'm engaged.
22:52	i'm sorry.
23:03	not bad. not bad.
23:05	ha ha ha ha.
23:06	keep practicing, and maybe you'll get it
23:08	by the time you're my age.
23:11	[panting]
23:12	hey, katara.
23:14	what do you think you're doing?
23:16	it's past sunrise.
23:18	you're late.
23:20	good to see you here.
23:21	you, too.
23:30	my fleet is ready.
23:33	set a course for the northern water tribe.
