00:09	WATER.
00:10	EARTH.
00:12	FIRE.
00:14	AIR.
00:16	LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.
00:21	THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.
00:25	ONLY THE AVATAR, MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,
00:28	COULD STOP THEM.
00:29	BUT WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED HIM MOST,
00:31	HE VANISHED.
00:33	100 YEARS PASSED, AND MY BROTHER AND I
00:35	DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR, AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG.
00:39	AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING SKILLS ARE GREAT,
00:40	HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN BEFORE HE'S READY TO SAVE ANYONE.
00:43	Aang: UNH!
00:44	BUT I BELIEVE AANG CAN SAVE THE WORLD.
01:32	[GRUNTING]
01:37	UM, AREN'T YOU FORGETTING THE TARP?
01:39	RIGHT. GOT IT.
01:41	SOKKA, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PUT THE TARP
01:43	ON TOP OF THE TENT.
01:45	YOU KNOW, SO WE DON'T GET RAINED ON?
01:47	ORDINARILY YOU'D BE RIGHT,
01:48	BUT SEEING HOW IT'S THE DRY SEASON,
01:50	YOU'RE NOT.
01:51	BESIDES, THAT TARP MAKES A PRETTY WARM BLANKET.
01:53	BUT WHAT IF IT DOES RAIN?
01:54	WHAT IF IT DOESN'T?
01:56	THEN I WOULD HAVE PUT THE TARP UP FOR NOTHING.
01:58	UH! YOU'RE INFURIATING.
02:00	KATARA, WHY DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT GATHERING THE FIREWOOD?
02:02	BECAUSE THAT KINDLING'S LOOKING PRETTY SORRY.
02:06	IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY FIREWOOD--
02:08	UH!
02:09	FINE BY ME! IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO YOUR JOB--
02:12	UH!
02:13	OK, I GOT THE GRUB IF YOU GUYS GOT THE--
02:16	HEY, WHERE'S THE CAMPFIRE,
02:17	AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TENT?
02:19	WHY DON'T YOU ASK MISS KNOW IT ALL, QUEEN OF THE TWIGS?
02:22	OH, YEAH? WELL, YOU'RE MR. LAZY BUM, KING OF THE...
02:26	TENTS!
02:27	[CHUCKLING]
02:28	OK. LISTEN, GUYS.
02:30	HARSH WORDS WON'T SOLVE PROBLEMS.
02:32	ACTION WILL.
02:34	WHY DON'T YOU JUST SWITCH JOBS?
02:36	SOUNDS GOOD.
02:36	WHATEVER.
02:37	YOU SEE THAT?
02:38	SETTLING FEUDS AND MAKING PEACE--
02:40	ALL IN A DAY'S WORK FOR THE AVATAR.
02:42	[YOWLING]
02:58	COME ON, MOMO. THAT'S FAIR.
03:00	APPA'S GOT 5 STOMACHS.
03:05	[CHATTERING]
03:07	THERE IT IS, GUYS-- THE GREAT DIVIDE.
03:10	WOW. I COULD JUST STARE AT IT FOREVER.
03:13	OK. I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.
03:14	HOW CAN YOU NOT BE FASCINATED, SOKKA?
03:17	THIS IS THE LARGEST CANYON IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.
03:20	THEN I'M SURE WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IT VERY CLEARLY
03:22	FROM THE AIR WHILE WE FLY AWAY.
03:24	HEY, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE CANYON GUIDE,
03:25	I WAS HERE FIRST.
03:27	OOH. CANYON GUIDE. SOUNDS INFORMATIVE.
03:30	BELIEVE ME, HE'S MORE THAN A TOUR GUIDE.
03:32	HE'S AN EARTHBENDER,
03:34	AND THE ONLY WAY IN AND OUT OF THE CANYON
03:35	IS WITH HIS HELP.
03:37	AND HE'S TAKING MY TRIBE ACROSS NEXT.
03:39	CALM DOWN. WE KNOW YOU'RE NEXT.
03:41	YOU WOULDN'T BE CALM IF THE FIRE NATION DESTROYED YOUR HOME
03:43	AND FORCED YOU TO FLEE.
03:45	MY WHOLE TRIBE HAS TO WALK THOUSANDS OF MILES
03:47	TO THE CAPITAL CITY OF FA SING SEI.
03:50	YOU'RE A REFUGEE.
03:52	HUH. TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW.
03:56	IS THAT YOUR TRIBE?
03:57	IT MOST CERTAINLY IS NOT.
03:59	THAT'S THE ZHANG TRIBE,
04:01	A BUNCH OF LOWLIFE THIEVES.
04:02	THEY'VE BEEN THE ENEMIES
04:04	OF MY TRIBE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.
04:05	[WHISTLES]
04:06	HEY, ZHANGS!
04:08	I'M SAVING A SPOT FOR MY TRIBE,
04:10	SO DON'T EVEN THINK OF STEALING IT.
04:12	WHERE ARE THE REST OF THE GAN JIN?
04:14	STILL TIDYING UP THEIR CAMPSITE?
04:16	YES, BUT THEY SENT ME AHEAD OF THEM
04:18	TO HOLD A SPOT.
04:20	I DIDN'T KNOW THE CANYON GUIDE TOOK RESERVATIONS.
04:22	HUH! OF COURSE HE DIDN'T.
04:24	THAT'S THE IGNORANCE I'D EXPECT
04:25	FROM A MESSY ZHANG,
04:27	SO UNORGANIZED AND ILL-PREPARED FOR A JOURNEY.
04:29	[MEN SHOUTING]
04:34	[CHATTERING]
04:36	UHH!
04:40	SORRY ABOUT THE WAIT, YOUNGSTERS.
04:43	WHO'S READY TO CROSS THIS HERE CANYON?
04:46	UH, ONE OF THEM, I THINK.
04:48	I WAS HERE FIRST. MY PARTY'S ON THEIR WAY.
04:51	I CAN'T GUIDE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T HERE.
04:54	GUESS YOU GUYS WILL HAVE TO MAKE THE TRIP TOMORROW.
04:58	WAIT! HERE THEY COME.
05:06	YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY GONNA CAVE IN
05:08	TO THESE SPOILED GAN JINS.
05:09	I MEAN, WE'RE REFUGEES, TOO,
05:11	AND WE'VE GOT SICK PEOPLE THAT NEED SHELTER.
05:14	I, UH, WELL...
05:16	WE'VE GOT OLD PEOPLE WHO ARE WEARY FROM TRAVELING.
05:18	SICK PEOPLE GET PRIORITY OVER OLD PEOPLE.
05:21	MAYBE YOU ZHANGS WOULDN'T HAVE SO MANY SICK PEOPLE
05:24	IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH SLOBS.
05:26	IF YOU GAN JINS WEREN'T SO CLEAN,
05:28	MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T LIVE TO BE SO OLD.
05:31	Gan Jin: I COULD SMELL YOUR STINK...
05:32	WELL, AANG, READY TO PUT
05:34	YOUR PEACEMAKING SKILLS TO THE TEST?
05:35	I-I DON'T KNOW.
05:36	A FIGHT OVER CHORES IS ONE THING.
05:38	THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FEUDING FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.
05:41	EVERYONE LISTEN UP!
05:43	THIS IS THE AVATAR,
05:45	AND IF YOU GIVE HIM A CHANCE,
05:46	I'M SURE HE CAN COME UP WITH A COMPROMISE
05:48	THAT WILL MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY.
05:52	UH, YOU COULD SHARE THE EARTHBENDER AND TRAVEL TOGETHER?
05:56	ABSOLUTELY NOT. WE'D RATHER BE TAKEN BY THE FIRE NATION
05:59	THAN TRAVEL WITH THOSE STINKING THIEVES.
06:02	WE WOULDN'T TRAVEL WITH YOU POMPOUS FOOLS ANYWAY.
06:04	[ALL ARGUING]
06:06	ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE DEAL!
06:07	YOU'RE ALL GOING DOWN TOGETHER,
06:09	AND APPA HERE WILL FLY YOUR SICK AND ELDERLY ACROSS.
06:12	DOES THAT SEEM FAIR?
06:24	SORRY, APPA. YOU'LL HAVE TO DO THIS ON YOUR OWN.
06:27	AANG, THIS FEUDING TRIBE STUFF IS SERIOUS BUSINESS.
06:30	ARE YOU SURE IT'S A GOOD IDEA GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS?
06:32	TO TELL THE TRUTH, I'M NOT SURE,
06:35	BUT WHEN HAVE I EVER BEEN?
06:36	HE'S THE AVATAR, SOKKA.
06:38	MAKING PEACE BETWEEN PEOPLE IS HIS JOB.
06:40	HIS JOB'S GONNA MAKE US CROSS THIS WHOLE THING ON FOOT, ISN'T IT?
06:44	OK, NOW COMES THE BAD NEWS.
06:46	NO FOOD ALLOWED IN THE CANYON.
06:49	IT ATTRACTS DANGEROUS PREDATORS.
06:53	NO FOOD? THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
06:56	OH, YOU BABIES CAN GO A DAY WITHOUT FOOD.
07:00	WOULD YOU RATHER BE HUNGRY OR DEAD?
07:04	NOW, WE'RE HEADING DOWN IN 10 MINUTES.
07:06	ALL FOOD BETTER BE IN YOUR GUT
07:09	OR IN THE GARBAGE!
07:16	APPA'S GONNA TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU TILL WE GET THERE.
07:20	SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE, BUDDY.
07:22	YIP YIP!
07:23	[GRUNT]
07:36	HUH!
07:38	Aang: NICE BENDING.
07:40	THE JOB'S MUCH MORE THAN BENDING, KID.
07:43	FOLKS WANT INFORMATION.
07:46	MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY WONDERING
07:48	HOW CANYONS ARE FORMED.
07:51	EXPERTS TELL US THIS CANYON WAS MOST LIKELY
07:53	CARVED INTO THE GROUND BY EARTH SPIRITS,
07:56	WHO WERE ANGRY AT LOCAL FARMERS
07:59	FOR NOT OFFERING THEM A PROPER SACRIFICE.
08:04	[GASP]
08:04	[GASP]
08:05	[RUMBLING]
08:08	[SCREAMING]
08:09	UH! HA HA! GUESS THE SPIRITS ARE STILL ANGRY.
08:14	HOPE YOU ALL BROUGHT SACRIFICES.
08:21	Guide: OK. EVERYONE STAND CLEAR OF THE WALL.
08:25	UH! UH!
08:30	WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
08:31	THESE PEOPLE ARE FLEEING
08:33	THE FIRE NATION, AREN'T THEY?
08:35	I'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN'T BE FOLLOWED.
08:37	WE'LL BE SAFE NOW.
08:39	UH!
08:41	AH!
08:44	WE'VE GOT TO HELP HIM! UH!
08:47	AAH!
08:49	[COUGH]
08:51	OK, NOW WE'VE GOT TO HELP ME!
08:58	AAH!
08:59	HAH!
09:14	WHAT WAS THAT?
09:15	CANYON CRAWLER.
09:17	OH. AND THERE'S SURE TO BE MORE.
09:20	YOUR ARMS-- THEY'RE BROKEN.
09:23	WITHOUT MY ARMS, I GOT NO BENDING.
09:25	IN OTHER WORDS...
09:27	WE'RE TRAPPED IN THIS CANYON.
09:39	I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT OF DITCHING OUR FOOD
09:41	WAS SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE CANYON CRAWLERS.
09:44	IT'S THE ZHANGS.
09:45	THEY TOOK FOOD DOWN HERE EVEN AFTER THE GUIDE TOLD THEM NOT TO.
09:49	WHAT?
09:51	IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO CAN'T GO WITHOUT FOOD FOR A DAY,
09:53	IT'S THESE PAMPERED GAN JINS.
09:55	Gan Jin: I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.
09:56	WE'RE STUCK IN THIS CANYON WITH NO WAY OUT.
09:59	WHY DON'T YOU THANK YOURSELF, FOOD-HIDER?
10:01	LOOK, STICKING TOGETHER IS THE ONLY WAY TO--
10:04	I'M NOT WALKING ANOTHER STEP WITH THE LIKES OF THEM.
10:07	NOW THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN AGREE ON.
10:10	ANY IDEAS?
10:11	NO BENDING. WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS CANYON.
10:13	I WON'T DIE DOWN HERE.
10:16	I WON'T BECOME PART OF THE FOOD CHAIN.
10:19	SEE? WE'RE GOING TO BECOME PART OF THE FOOD CHAIN
10:22	BECAUSE OF YOU.
10:23	SURE. UNJUSTLY BLAME THE ZHANGS, LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.
10:26	GLADLY.
10:28	Aang: ENOUGH!
10:29	I THOUGHT I COULD HELP YOU GUYS GET ALONG,
10:31	BUT I GUESS THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
10:35	WE SHOULD SPLIT UP--
10:36	GAN JINS ON THIS SIDE AND ZHANGS ON THAT SIDE.
10:39	WE'LL TRAVEL IN TWO SEPARATE LINES.
10:48	SOKKA, YOU GO WITH THE ZHANGS,
10:50	AND, KATARA, YOU GO WITH THE GAN JINS.
10:52	SEE IF YOU CAN FIND OUT
10:53	WHY THEY HATE EACH OTHER SO MUCH.
11:14	SO YOU GUYS AREN'T GONNA PUT UP YOUR TARPS?
11:16	WHAT FOR? IT'S THE DRY SEASON.
11:18	EXACTLY!
11:20	BESIDES, WE LIKE TO USE THE TARP AS A BLANKET.
11:23	FINALLY SOMEONE GETS IT.
11:32	DO YOU REALLY THINK IT'LL RAIN?
11:34	NO, BUT YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO CAREFUL, RIGHT?
11:52	[GASP]
11:56	WOULD YOU CARE FOR SOME BREAD, KATARA?
11:58	SO IT WAS YOU GUYS WHO HAD FOOD.
12:00	OH, COME NOW.
12:01	DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT TRIBE OF THIEVES
12:02	ISN'T SMUGGLING FOOD?
12:04	WHY SHOULD MY PEOPLE GO HUNGRY
12:06	WHEN THE SNEAKY ZHANGS ARE STUFFING THEIR FACES?
12:09	WELL, I GUESS IT'S OK IF EVERYONE'S DOING IT.
12:17	SO WHY DOES YOUR TRIBE HATE THE ZHANGS SO MUCH?
12:21	YOU SEEM LIKE A SMART GIRL, KATARA.
12:23	I BET YOU WOULD ENJOY HEARING SOME HISTORY.
12:33	Gan Jin: THE PATRIARCH OF OUR TRIBE, GHIN WAI,
12:36	WAS AN EARTHBENDER WARRIOR
12:37	WHO WAS ASSIGNED AN IMPORTANT DUTY:
12:40	TRANSPORTING OUR SACRED ORB
12:42	FROM THE GREAT EASTERN GATE TO THE GREAT WESTERN GATE.
12:51	TAKING THE ORB FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST
12:53	REPRESENTS THE SUN'S RISING AND SETTING.
12:56	IT WAS OUR TRIBE'S ANCIENT REDEMPTION RITUAL.
13:01	BUT AS HE APPROACHED THE GATE,
13:02	GHIN WAI WAS ATTACKED BY ONE OF THE ZHANGS--
13:06	A VERMIN NAMED WAI GHIN
13:08	WHO LOOKED AT THE ORB WITH ENVY.
13:11	THAT COWARD WAI GHIN KNOCKED GHIN WAI TO THE GROUND
13:15	AND STOLE OUR SACRED ORB.
13:19	OUR PEOPLE HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN.
13:21	YOU CAN NEVER TRUST A ZHANG.
13:30	CARE FOR SOME MEAT?
13:31	WOULD I?
13:33	I KNOW WHAT YOU MUST BE THINKING.
13:35	WE'RE HORRIBLE FOR ENDANGERING EVERYBODY
13:37	BY BRINGING FOOD DOWN HERE.
13:38	MM-HMM.
13:40	THE GAN JINS THINK SO BADLY OF US,
13:41	THEY PROBABLY ASSUMED WE BROUGHT FOOD IN
13:44	AND DECIDED TO BRING FOOD IN THEMSELVES.
13:46	THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT FOOD IN.
13:47	MMM.
13:48	OUR CONFLICT WITH THE GAN JIN
13:50	GOES BACK OVER 100 YEARS.
13:57	Zhang: OUR FOREFATHER, WAI GHIN, WAS LEAVING THE WESTERN GATE
13:59	OF OUR VILLAGE WHEN HE SAW A FIGURE IN THE DISTANCE.
14:03	IT WAS A MAN OF THE GAN JIN TRIBE--GHIN WAI--
14:07	COLLAPSED ON THE GROUND.
14:09	NOBLE WAI GHIN STOPPED TO HELP HIM.
14:11	GHIN WAI WAS TRANSPORTING A SACRED ORB,
14:14	A VERY POWERFUL RELIC USED IN HIS TRIBE'S REDEMPTION RITUAL.
14:18	WAI GHIN TRIED TO TEND TO THE MAN'S WOUNDS,
14:20	BUT GHIN WAI INSISTED THE ORB WAS MORE IMPORTANT
14:24	AND ASKED HIM TO TAKE IT BACK TO HIS TRIBE.
14:26	KIND WAI GHIN PROMISED TO SEND HELP FOR THE MAN
14:30	AS SOON AS HE COULD.
14:31	BUT AS WAI GHIN CROSSED THE BORDER
14:33	TO RETURN THE ORB INTO GAN JIN TERRITORY,
14:35	HE WAS ARRESTED.
14:37	[SWORDS CLANG]
14:41	INSTEAD OF THANKING HIM FOR HIS KIND AND SELFLESS DEED,
14:44	THEY SENTENCED HIM TO 20 LONG YEARS IN PRISON.
14:49	WE ZHANGS WILL NEVER FORGET THAT INJUSTICE.
14:53	THAT'S JUST TERRIBLE.
14:55	ARE YOU GONNA FINISH THAT?
14:56	[GRUNTING]
14:58	Aang: SURE WOULD BE NICE
14:59	TO BE AROUND ONE OF THOSE CAMPFIRES
15:01	TELLING STORIES AND LAUGHING.
15:04	IT'S OK, MOMO. WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE SOON ENOUGH,
15:07	AND THEN WE CAN EAT OUR WEIGHT IN LITCHI NUTS.
15:10	[SQUEAK]
15:11	[BUZZING]
15:15	[SQUEAKS]
15:16	NAH. I'LL WAIT FOR THE LITCHI NUTS.
15:19	Guide: IT'S LONELY, ISN'T IT, BEING IMPARTIAL?
15:23	I WISH I COULD HELP THESE PEOPLE GET ALONG,
15:25	BUT IT JUST SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.
15:27	ANYHOW, I GUESS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM
15:29	IS GETTING OUT OF HERE.
15:30	I'M NOT SO SURE THE TWO PROBLEMS ARE UNRELATED.
15:42	ALL CLEAR. WE'RE ALMOST TO THE OTHER SIDE.
15:55	Aang: KATARA, SOKKO, WILL THESE PEOPLE COOPERATE LONG ENOUGH
15:58	TO GET OUT OF THE CANYON?
16:00	I DON'T THINK SO, AANG.
16:01	THE ZHANGS REALLY WRONGED THE GAN JINS.
16:03	THEY AMBUSHED GHIN WAI AND STOLE THE SACRED ORB.
16:06	WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
16:08	YEAH, KATARA, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
16:10	WAI GHIN DIDN'T STEAL THE ORB.
16:12	HE WAS RETURNING IT TO THEIR VILLAGE GATE
16:14	AND WAS WRONGFULLY PUNISHED BY THE GAN JIN.
16:16	NOT PUNISHED ENOUGH, IF YOU ASK ME.
16:18	OK, OK. I GET IT. NOW I NEED YOUR HELP.
16:21	LET'S GET EVERYONE TOGETHER
16:22	AT THE BASE OF THE CANYON WALL.
16:26	[CROWD CHEERING]
16:32	PLEASE, EVERYONE. AS SOON AS WE GET OUT OF HERE,
16:34	WE CAN EAT AND THEN GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS.
16:36	BUT I NEED YOU ALL TO PUT YOUR HEADS TOGETHER
16:38	AND FIGURE OUT A WAY UP THIS CLIFF.
16:40	MAYBE THE ZHANG CAN CLIMB THE WALL
16:42	WITH THEIR LONG, DISGUSTING FINGERNAILS.
16:44	Zhang: OH, SORRY. I FORGOT THAT TO THE GAN JIN,
16:47	UNCLIPPED FINGERNAILS IS A CRIME
16:50	PUNISHABLE BY 20 YEARS IN JAIL.
16:51	WHY, YOU DIRTY THIEF.
16:53	YOU POMPOUS FOOL.
16:55	[ALL SHOUTING AT ONCE]
16:57	GUYS, FOCUS!
16:59	HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?
17:00	HARSH WORDS WON'T SOLVE PROBLEMS.
17:02	ACTION WILL!
17:05	PERHAPS THE AVATAR IS RIGHT.
17:07	YES. PERHAPS HE IS.
17:11	HARSH WORDS WILL NEVER SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS.
17:14	ACTION WILL.
17:18	HUH!
17:18	HUH!
17:19	AAH!
17:24	TO THE DEATH, AND LET THIS BE THE END OF THIS RIVALRY.
17:28	Aang: YOU KNOW, I TAKE IT BACK.
17:30	HARSH WORDS AREN'T SO BAD.
17:40	HUH?
17:43	[GRUNTS]
17:48	HYAH!
17:57	Aang: IS THAT FOOD?
18:00	EVERYONE SMUGGLED FOOD DOWN HERE?
18:02	UNBELIEVABLE!
18:03	YOU GUYS PUT OUR LIVES IN DANGER
18:05	BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T GO WITHOUT A SNACK FOR A DAY?
18:07	YOU ARE ALL AWFUL!
18:17	SO HUNGRY.
18:19	IS THAT EGG CUSTARD IN THAT TART?
18:27	[SCREECHING]
18:28	[SHOUTING]
18:31	OH, NO. THAT'S A LOT OF CANYON CRAWLERS.
18:35	WE BARELY SURVIVED ONE.
18:37	Guide: THEY'RE COMING BACK FOR ME.
18:39	THEY'VE HAD A TASTE, AND THEY'RE COMING BACK FOR ME.
18:42	SOKKA, WAIT.
18:43	I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE STUPID FEUD.
18:45	I JUST WANT US TO GET OUT OF HERE ALIVE.
18:48	ME, TOO. I ONLY TOOK THEIR SIDE BECAUSE THEY FED ME.
18:51	[SNORTING]
18:56	HYAH!
19:10	HYAH!
19:17	[GASP]
19:19	[SHOUTING]
19:24	AAH!
19:25	[SCREAMING]
19:30	AAH!
19:31	[PANTING]
19:52	EVERYBODY, WATCH ME AND DO WHAT I DO!
20:22	NOW FOLLOW ME.
20:24	WE'RE RIDING OUT OF THIS HOLE.
20:43	EVERYONE GET OFF!
20:49	WE MADE IT!
20:51	UH!
20:54	HUH!
21:03	I NEVER THOUGHT A GAN JIN
21:05	COULD GET HIS HANDS DIRTY LIKE THAT.
21:06	AND I NEVER KNEW YOU ZHANGS
21:08	WERE SO RELIABLE IN A PINCH.
21:10	PERHAPS WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT AFTER ALL.
21:12	[SIGH]
21:14	TOO BAD WE CAN'T REWRITE HISTORY.
21:16	YOU THIEVES STOLE OUR SACRED ORB FROM GHIN WAI.
21:20	YOU TYRANTS UNJUSTLY IMPRISONED WAI GHIN FOR 20 LONG YEARS.
21:25	UGH. WAIT A SECOND.
21:28	GHIN WAI? WAI GHIN? I KNOW THOSE GUYS.
21:32	YES, YES. WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE STORY.
21:35	NO, I MEAN I REALLY KNEW THEM.
21:37	I MIGHT NOT LOOK IT, BUT I'M 112 YEARS OLD.
21:40	I WAS THERE 100 YEARS AGO
21:42	ON THE DAY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
21:44	THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
21:47	FIRST OF ALL, GHIN WAI AND WAI GHIN WEREN'T ENEMIES.
21:50	THEY WERE BROTHERS-- TWINS, IN FACT.
21:53	AND THEY WERE 8, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
21:56	THEY WERE JUST PLAYING A GAME.
21:58	AHH!
21:58	AHH!
21:59	THE SACRED ORB FROM THE LEGEND--
22:00	THAT WAS THE BALL.
22:02	AND THE EASTERN AND WESTERN GATES
22:03	WERE THE GOAL POSTS.
22:05	GHIN WAI HAD THE BALL AND WAS RUNNING TOWARD THE GOAL
22:07	WHEN HE FELL AND FUMBLED IT.
22:09	WAI GHIN DIDN'T STEAL THE BALL.
22:11	HE PICKED IT UP AND STARTED RUNNING IT BACK
22:13	TOWARD THE OTHER GOAL, BUT HE STEPPED OUT OF BOUNDS.
22:15	[BLOWS WHISTLE]
22:17	SO THE OFFICIAL PUT HIM IN THE PENALTY BOX--
22:19	NOT FOR 20 LONG YEARS BUT FOR 2 SHORT MINUTES.
22:22	HEE HEE HEE!
22:23	THERE WAS NO STEALING AND NO PUTTING ANYONE IN PRISON--
22:26	JUST A GAME.
22:28	YOU'RE SAYING THE SACRED ORB WAS ACTUALLY A SACRED BALL?
22:31	NOPE, JUST A REGULAR BALL.
22:33	WHAT ABOUT OUR TRIBE'S REDEMPTION RITUAL?
22:35	THAT'S WHAT THE GAME WAS CALLED--REDEMPTION.
22:38	AS SOON AS SOMEONE GOT THE BALL FROM ONE GOAL TO THE OTHER,
22:41	EVERYONE WOULD YELL "REDEMPTION!"
22:45	DON'T GET ME WRONG-- WAI GHIN WAS KIND OF A SLOB,
22:47	AND GHIN WAI WAS A LITTLE STUFFY.
22:48	THAT MUCH IS TRUE.
22:50	BUT THEY RESPECTED EACH OTHER'S DIFFERENCES
22:52	ENOUGH TO SHARE THE SAME PLAYING FIELD.
22:55	I SUPPOSE IT'S TIME WE FORGET THE PAST.
22:58	AND LOOK TO THE FUTURE.
23:09	GOOD TO SEE YOU, BOY. DID YOU MISS ME? HA HA HA!
23:12	I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH, AVATAR.
23:15	WELL, YOU KNOW. I TRY.
23:16	OH!
23:19	LET US TRAVEL TO THE EARTH KINGDOM CAPITAL
23:22	AS ONE TRIBE.
23:24	[CHEERING]
23:25	I'M GOING, TOO!
23:27	I'M SICK OF THIS PLACE.
23:29	THAT'S SOME LUCK YOU KNEW GHIN WAI AND WAI GHIN.
23:32	YOU COULD CALL IT LUCK,
23:34	OR YOU COULD CALL IT LYING.
23:35	WHAT?
23:36	I MADE THE WHOLE THING UP.
23:38	YOU DID NOT.
23:40	THAT IS SO WRONG.
23:42	NOW, WHERE'S THAT CUSTARD TART?
23:44	I'M STARVING!
