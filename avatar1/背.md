Aang, before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders. 

What about them? 

Well... I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The fire nation is ruthless. They killed my mother, and they could have done the same to your people. 

Just because no one has seen an airbender doesn't mean the fire nation killed them all. They probably escaped. 

I know it's hard to accept. 

You don't understand, katara.The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the fire nation has any flying bison.

The only reason you should be interrupting me is if you have news about the avatar. 

Well, there is news, prince zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset. 

Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader. Now, whatever you have to say, I'm sure I can take it. 

Ok, then. We have no idea where he is. What? You really should open a window in here. 

Give me the map! 

There have been multiple sightings of the avatar, but he is impossible to track down. 

How am I going to find him, uncle? He is clearly a master of evasive(/ɪˈveɪsɪv/) maneuvering (/məˈnuːvərɪŋ/).  规避，机动
