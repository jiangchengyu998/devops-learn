00:09	katara: water...

00:11	earth...

00:13	fire...

00:15	air...

00:17	long ago, the 4 nations lived together in harmony.

00:22	then, everything changed when the fire nation attacked.

00:26	only the avatar, master of all 4 elements,

00:29	could stop them.

00:30	but when the world needed him most,

00:32	he vanished.

00:33	a hundred years passed, and my brother and i

00:36	discovered the new avatar, an airbender named aang.

00:39	and although his airbending skills were great,

00:41	he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

00:45	but i believe aang can save the world.

00:58	katara, voice-over: when the avatar dies,

01:00	he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.

01:02	aang: that's avatar roku,

01:04	the avatar before me.

01:06	when you are ready, he will reveal himself to you.

01:09	i lost my mother in a fire nation raid.

01:13	this necklace is all i have left of her.

01:20	the world has changed in the hundred years you've been gone.

01:23	it's the duty of the avatar to restore balance

01:26	to the world by defeating fire lord ozai.

01:29	send word to the fire lord immediately.

01:32	the avatar has returned.

01:47	[squawk]

01:51	[appa growling]

01:55	katara: those clouds look so soft, don't they?

01:57	like you could just jump down

01:59	and you'd land in a big, soft, cottony heap.

02:02	maybe you should give it a try.

02:03	you're hilarious.

02:05	i'll try it!

02:06	ha ha ha!

02:09	yeah!

02:17	turns out, clouds are made of water.

02:24	hey, what is that?

02:30	it's like a scar.

02:36	sokka: listen.

02:38	it's so quiet.

02:40	there's no life anywhere.

02:41	aang, are you ok?

02:44	fire nation!

02:46	those evil savages make me sick.

02:47	they have no respect for--

02:49	shh.

02:50	what, i'm not allowed to be angry?

02:54	[sigh]

02:57	why would anyone do this?

02:59	how could i let this happen?

03:01	aang, you didn't let this happen.

03:03	it has nothing to do with you.

03:05	yes, it does.

03:07	it's the avatar's job to protect nature,

03:09	but i don't know how to do my job.

03:11	that's why we're going to the north pole--

03:13	to find you a teacher.

03:14	yeah. a waterbending teacher.

03:17	but there's no one who can teach me how to be the avatar.

03:19	monk gyatsu said that avatar roku would help me.

03:22	the avatar before you?

03:24	he died over a hundred years ago.

03:26	how are you supposed to talk to him?

03:28	i don't know.

03:30	[purring]

03:34	uncle, it's time to leave.

03:36	where are you? uncle iroh!

03:39	over here.

03:40	uncle?

03:42	we need to move on.

03:43	we're closing in on the avatar's trail,

03:45	and i don't want to lose him.

03:47	you look tired, prince zuko.

03:50	why don't you join me in these hot springs

03:53	and soak away your troubles?

03:56	my troubles cannot be soaked away.

03:58	it's time to go!

04:00	you should take your teacher's advice

04:03	and relax a little.

04:05	the temperature's just right.

04:08	i heated it myself.

04:13	enough. we need to leave now.

04:16	get out of the water!

04:17	very well.

04:18	on second thought,

04:20	why don't you take another few minutes?

04:22	but be back at the ship in half an hour,

04:23	or i'm leaving without you.

04:25	ahh.

04:29	katara: hey, aang.

04:30	are you ready to be cheered up?

04:31	no.

04:32	ow!

04:35	hey, how is that cheering me up?

04:37	[chuckling]

04:38	cheered me up.

04:39	ow!

04:41	yeah, i probably deserved that.

04:43	these acorns are everywhere, aang.

04:46	that means the forest will grow back.

04:49	every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday,

04:51	and all the birds and animals

04:53	that lived here will come back.

04:57	thanks, katara.

04:59	[gasp]

05:02	sokka: hey, who are you?

05:04	when i saw the flying bison,

05:06	i thought it was impossible,

05:08	but those markings...

05:10	are you the avatar, child?

05:16	my village desperately needs your help.

05:32	this young person is the avatar.

05:36	so the rumors of your return are true.

05:39	it is the greatest honor of a lifetime

05:41	to be in your presence.

05:43	nice to meet you, too.

05:46	so, is there something in can help you with?

05:49	i'm not sure.

05:51	our village is in crisis.

05:53	he's our only hope.

05:55	for the last few days at sunset,

05:58	a spirit monster comes and attacks our village.

06:01	he is hei bai,

06:04	the black and white spirit.

06:06	why is it attacking you?

06:08	we do not know.

06:09	but each of the last 3 nights,

06:11	he has abducted one of our own.

06:13	we are especially fearful

06:15	because the winter solstice draws near.

06:17	what happens then?

06:19	as the solstice approaches,

06:21	the natural world and the spirit world

06:23	grow closer and closer,

06:25	until the line between them

06:27	is blurred completely.

06:29	hei bai is already causing devastation and destruction.

06:33	once the solstice is here,

06:35	there is no telling what will happen.

06:37	so what do you want me to do exactly?

06:40	who better to resolve a crisis

06:42	between our world and the spirit world

06:45	than the avatar himself?

06:47	you are the great bridge

06:49	between man and spirits.

06:51	right. that's me.

06:54	hey, great bridge guy.

06:56	can i talk to you over here for a second?

06:59	aang, you seem a little unsure about all this.

07:02	yeah. that might be because i don't know anything at all

07:05	about the spirit world.

07:08	it's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff.

07:10	so, can you help these people?

07:13	i have to try, don't i?

07:15	maybe whatever i have to do will just...

07:17	come to me.

07:18	[purring]

07:20	i think you can do it, aang.

07:23	yeah.

07:25	we're all gonna get eaten by a spirit monster.

07:33	[snoring]

07:35	[rustling]

07:37	who's there?

07:39	[squeaking]

07:40	a meadow vole.

07:42	i should have known.

07:44	you startled me, little one.

07:47	[sigh]

07:49	seems i dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline,

07:52	but it was a very sweet nap.

07:55	[squeaking]

08:00	[rumbling]

08:04	uhh!

08:08	he's a fire nation soldier.

08:09	he's no ordinary soldier.

08:12	this is the fire lord's brother.

08:14	the dragon of the west--

08:15	the once great general iroh.

08:18	but now, he's our prisoner.

08:32	hello? spirit? can you hear me?

08:35	this is the avatar speaking.

08:38	i'm here to try to help stuff.

08:41	this isn't right.

08:42	we can't sit here and cower while aang waits for some monster to show up.

08:46	if anyone can save us, he can.

08:48	he still shouldn't have to face this alone.

08:57	the sun is set.

08:58	where are you, hei bai?

09:01	well, spirit, uh,

09:04	i hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace.

09:11	ok. well, i guess that's settled, then.

09:16	[voices whispering]

09:35	you must be the hei bai spirit. my name is--

09:39	[roars]

09:45	my name is aang. i'm the avatar, and i would like to help.

09:48	hey, wait up!

09:54	[roaring]

10:01	uh...

10:03	the avatar's methods are...

10:05	unusual.

10:07	it doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying.

10:09	maybe we should go help him.

10:12	no. only the avatar stands a chance against the hei bai.

10:15	aang will figure out the right thing to do, sokka.

10:21	please, would you stop destroying things and listen?

10:24	i'm just trying to do my job as spirit bridge.

10:27	excuse me.

10:28	would you please turn around?

10:31	i command you to turn around now!

10:34	uhh!

10:38	that's it. he needs help.

10:40	sokka! wait!

10:43	leader: it's not safe.

10:44	hei bai. over here!

10:50	sokka! go back!

10:52	we'll fight him together, aang.

10:54	i don't want to fight him unless i--

11:02	sokka!

11:10	uncle.

11:11	uncle, where are you?

11:13	sir, maybe he thought you left without him.

11:15	something's not right here.

11:18	that pile of rocks.

11:20	it looks like there's been a landslide, sir.

11:22	land doesn't slide uphill.

11:24	those rocks didn't move naturally.

11:27	my uncle's been captured by earthbenders.

11:35	[gasping]

11:40	sokka: aang! over here!

11:50	help!

11:51	hang on, sokka!

11:55	[grunting]

12:00	aah!

12:01	uhh!

12:10	sokka!

12:14	i've failed.

12:30	where are you taking me?

12:32	we're taking you to face justice.

12:34	right.

12:36	but where, specifically?

12:38	a place you're quite familiar with, actually.

12:40	you once laid siege to it for 600 days,

12:44	but it would not yield to you.

12:46	ah, the great city of ba sing se.

12:51	it was greater than you were, apparently.

12:53	i acknowledge my defeat at ba sing se.

12:57	after 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and i was tired.

13:05	[yawn]

13:07	and i'm still tired.

13:30	i'm sure they'll be back.

13:32	i know.

13:36	you should get some rest.

13:38	everything's gonna be ok.

13:41	your brother is in good hands.

13:44	i would be shocked

13:46	if the avatar returned without him.

13:48	katara? katara, i lost him.

13:54	the sun is rising.

13:56	perhaps he will return soon.

13:59	what? no. i'm right here.

14:01	grr!

14:02	[grunting]

14:10	i'm in the spirit world.

14:20	ugh. yep, that's uncle iroh.

14:27	aang: i'll figure this out, katara. i promise.

14:30	like they said, i'm the bridge

14:31	between the worlds, right?

14:33	all i have to do is figure out what i have to do,

14:36	but once i do that, no problem.

14:39	[growling]

14:41	appa. hey, buddy. i'm right here.

14:44	but i guess you can't see me, either.

14:47	[dull roar]

14:49	it's ok, appa. don't worry.

14:51	i'm sure they're on their way back.

14:53	i bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches, for a treat.

14:58	what am i supposed to do?

15:01	avatar roku, how can i talk to you?

15:06	sokka?

15:12	[growling]

15:13	that's definitely not sokka.

15:18	uhh!

15:25	what?

15:27	i can't airbend in the spirit world.

15:32	[growling]

15:38	[growling]

15:45	you don't know where sokka is, do you?

15:50	[whimpering]

15:57	you're avatar roku's animal guide, like appa is to me.

16:02	i need to save my friend, and i don't know how.

16:04	is there some way for me to talk to roku?

16:11	i'll be back, katara.

16:14	take me to roku.

16:27	[gasp]

16:31	oh.

16:33	what's the problem?

16:35	nothing.

16:36	actually, there is a bit of a problem.

16:40	my old joints are feeling sore and achy, and these shackles are too loose.

16:46	too loose?

16:47	that's right. the cuffs are loose, and they jangle around and bump my wrists.

16:53	it would help me if you would tighten them

16:55	so they wouldn't shake around so much.

16:58	very well.

17:00	corporal, tighten the prisoner's handcuffs.

17:07	aah!

17:10	aah!

17:13	aah!

17:29	aang: hey! what are you doing?!

17:30	aah!

17:38	i don't understand.

17:40	this is just a statue of roku.

17:51	is that what roku wants to talk to me about?

17:54	a comet?

17:56	when can i talk to him?

17:58	[growling]

18:25	it's a calendar,

18:27	and the light will reach roku on the solstice.

18:30	so that's when i'll be able to speak to roku?

18:32	[growling]

18:34	but i can't wait that long.

18:35	i need to save sokka now!

18:40	ugh! uhh!

18:43	hyah!

18:51	he is too dangerous, captain.

18:54	we can't just carry him to the capital.

18:56	we have to do something now.

18:57	i agree.

18:59	he must be dealt with immediately

19:00	and severely.

19:02	ptoh!

19:06	katara: it's no use, appa. i don't see them anywhere.

19:09	our best hope is to go back to the village and wait.

19:12	[appa growls]

19:19	the avatar.

19:33	whoa.

19:35	aah!

20:05	you're back!

20:08	where's sokka?

20:10	i'm not sure.

20:17	captain: these dangerous hands must be crushed.

20:20	[grunting]

20:25	hyah!

20:29	hyah!

20:30	excellent form, prince zuko.

20:33	you taught me well.

20:34	captain: surrender yourselves.

20:35	it's 5 against 2.

20:37	you're clearly outnumbered.

20:39	uh, that's true,

20:41	but you are clearly outmatched.

20:44	hy...ah!

20:46	yah!

20:46	yah!

20:50	hyah! hyah!

20:54	[grunting]

20:56	hyah!

20:57	uhh!

20:57	uhh!

21:03	uhh!

21:04	uhh! uhh!

21:09	yah!

21:13	oh!

21:15	[soldiers groaning]

21:21	now, would you please put on some clothes?

21:24	[voices whispering]

21:36	[chiming]

21:44	aah!

21:46	aang! what are you doing?!

21:48	run!

21:49	[roaring]

22:04	[roaring]

22:06	you're the spirit of this forest.

22:08	now i understand.

22:10	you're upset and angry

22:12	because your home was burned down.

22:14	when i saw the forest had burned,

22:16	i was sad and upset,

22:17	but my friend gave me hope

22:19	that the forest would grow back.

22:40	sokka!

22:43	what happened?

22:45	you were trapped in the spirit world for 24 hours.

22:48	how are you feeling?

22:49	like i seriously need to use the bathroom.

22:53	thank you, avatar.

22:55	if only there were a way to repay you for what you've done.

22:59	you could give us some supplies and some money.

23:01	sokka.

23:01	what?

23:03	we need stuff.

23:05	it would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey.

23:09	i'm so proud of you, aang.

23:11	you figured out what to do all on your own.

23:13	actually, i did have a little help.

23:16	and there's something else.

23:21	what is it?

23:22	i need to talk to roku, and i think i found a way to contact his spirit.

23:27	that's great.

23:27	creepy, but great.

23:29	there's a temple on a crescent-shaped island,

23:31	and if i go there on the solstice,

23:33	i'll be able to speak with him.

23:35	but the solstice is tomorrow.

23:37	yeah, and there's one more problem.

23:39	the island is in the fire nation.
