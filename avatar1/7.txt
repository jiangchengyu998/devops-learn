00:09	Katara: WATER...
00:11	EARTH...
00:13	FIRE...
00:15	AIR...
00:17	LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.
00:22	THEN, EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.
00:26	ONLY THE AVATAR, MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,
00:29	COULD STOP THEM.
00:30	BUT WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED HIM MOST,
00:32	HE VANISHED.
00:33	A HUNDRED YEARS PASSED, AND MY BROTHER AND I
00:36	DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR, AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG.
00:39	AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING SKILLS WERE GREAT,
00:41	HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN BEFORE HE'S READY TO SAVE ANYONE.
00:45	BUT I BELIEVE AANG CAN SAVE THE WORLD.
00:58	Katara, voice-over: WHEN THE AVATAR DIES,
01:00	HE'S REINCARNATED INTO THE NEXT NATION IN THE CYCLE.
01:02	Aang: THAT'S AVATAR ROKU,
01:04	THE AVATAR BEFORE ME.
01:06	WHEN YOU ARE READY, HE WILL REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU.
01:09	I LOST MY MOTHER IN A FIRE NATION RAID.
01:13	THIS NECKLACE IS ALL I HAVE LEFT OF HER.
01:20	THE WORLD HAS CHANGED IN THE HUNDRED YEARS YOU'VE BEEN GONE.
01:23	IT'S THE DUTY OF THE AVATAR TO RESTORE BALANCE
01:26	TO THE WORLD BY DEFEATING FIRE LORD OZAI.
01:29	SEND WORD TO THE FIRE LORD IMMEDIATELY.
01:32	THE AVATAR HAS RETURNED.
01:47	[SQUAWK]
01:51	[APPA GROWLING]
01:55	Katara: THOSE CLOUDS LOOK SO SOFT, DON'T THEY?
01:57	LIKE YOU COULD JUST JUMP DOWN
01:59	AND YOU'D LAND IN A BIG, SOFT, COTTONY HEAP.
02:02	MAYBE YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY.
02:03	YOU'RE HILARIOUS.
02:05	I'LL TRY IT!
02:06	HA HA HA!
02:09	YEAH!
02:17	TURNS OUT, CLOUDS ARE MADE OF WATER.
02:24	HEY, WHAT IS THAT?
02:30	IT'S LIKE A SCAR.
02:36	Sokka: LISTEN.
02:38	IT'S SO QUIET.
02:40	THERE'S NO LIFE ANYWHERE.
02:41	AANG, ARE YOU OK?
02:44	FIRE NATION!
02:46	THOSE EVIL SAVAGES MAKE ME SICK.
02:47	THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR--
02:49	SHH.
02:50	WHAT, I'M NOT ALLOWED TO BE ANGRY?
02:54	[SIGH]
02:57	WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THIS?
02:59	HOW COULD I LET THIS HAPPEN?
03:01	AANG, YOU DIDN'T LET THIS HAPPEN.
03:03	IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.
03:05	YES, IT DOES.
03:07	IT'S THE AVATAR'S JOB TO PROTECT NATURE,
03:09	BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO MY JOB.
03:11	THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO THE NORTH POLE--
03:13	TO FIND YOU A TEACHER.
03:14	YEAH. A WATERBENDING TEACHER.
03:17	BUT THERE'S NO ONE WHO CAN TEACH ME HOW TO BE THE AVATAR.
03:19	MONK GYATSU SAID THAT AVATAR ROKU WOULD HELP ME.
03:22	THE AVATAR BEFORE YOU?
03:24	HE DIED OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.
03:26	HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO TALK TO HIM?
03:28	I DON'T KNOW.
03:30	[PURRING]
03:34	UNCLE, IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.
03:36	WHERE ARE YOU? UNCLE IROH!
03:39	OVER HERE.
03:40	UNCLE?
03:42	WE NEED TO MOVE ON.
03:43	WE'RE CLOSING IN ON THE AVATAR'S TRAIL,
03:45	AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE HIM.
03:47	YOU LOOK TIRED, PRINCE ZUKO.
03:50	WHY DON'T YOU JOIN ME IN THESE HOT SPRINGS
03:53	AND SOAK AWAY YOUR TROUBLES?
03:56	MY TROUBLES CANNOT BE SOAKED AWAY.
03:58	IT'S TIME TO GO!
04:00	YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR TEACHER'S ADVICE
04:03	AND RELAX A LITTLE.
04:05	THE TEMPERATURE'S JUST RIGHT.
04:08	I HEATED IT MYSELF.
04:13	ENOUGH. WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW.
04:16	GET OUT OF THE WATER!
04:17	VERY WELL.
04:18	ON SECOND THOUGHT,
04:20	WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ANOTHER FEW MINUTES?
04:22	BUT BE BACK AT THE SHIP IN HALF AN HOUR,
04:23	OR I'M LEAVING WITHOUT YOU.
04:25	AHH.
04:29	Katara: HEY, AANG.
04:30	ARE YOU READY TO BE CHEERED UP?
04:31	NO.
04:32	OW!
04:35	HEY, HOW IS THAT CHEERING ME UP?
04:37	[CHUCKLING]
04:38	CHEERED ME UP.
04:39	OW!
04:41	YEAH, I PROBABLY DESERVED THAT.
04:43	THESE ACORNS ARE EVERYWHERE, AANG.
04:46	THAT MEANS THE FOREST WILL GROW BACK.
04:49	EVERY ONE OF THESE WILL BE A TALL OAK TREE SOMEDAY,
04:51	AND ALL THE BIRDS AND ANIMALS
04:53	THAT LIVED HERE WILL COME BACK.
04:57	THANKS, KATARA.
04:59	[GASP]
05:02	Sokka: HEY, WHO ARE YOU?
05:04	WHEN I SAW THE FLYING BISON,
05:06	I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE,
05:08	BUT THOSE MARKINGS...
05:10	ARE YOU THE AVATAR, CHILD?
05:16	MY VILLAGE DESPERATELY NEEDS YOUR HELP.
05:32	THIS YOUNG PERSON IS THE AVATAR.
05:36	SO THE RUMORS OF YOUR RETURN ARE TRUE.
05:39	IT IS THE GREATEST HONOR OF A LIFETIME
05:41	TO BE IN YOUR PRESENCE.
05:43	NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.
05:46	SO, IS THERE SOMETHING IN CAN HELP YOU WITH?
05:49	I'M NOT SURE.
05:51	OUR VILLAGE IS IN CRISIS.
05:53	HE'S OUR ONLY HOPE.
05:55	FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS AT SUNSET,
05:58	A SPIRIT MONSTER COMES AND ATTACKS OUR VILLAGE.
06:01	HE IS HEI BAI,
06:04	THE BLACK AND WHITE SPIRIT.
06:06	WHY IS IT ATTACKING YOU?
06:08	WE DO NOT KNOW.
06:09	BUT EACH OF THE LAST 3 NIGHTS,
06:11	HE HAS ABDUCTED ONE OF OUR OWN.
06:13	WE ARE ESPECIALLY FEARFUL
06:15	BECAUSE THE WINTER SOLSTICE DRAWS NEAR.
06:17	WHAT HAPPENS THEN?
06:19	AS THE SOLSTICE APPROACHES,
06:21	THE NATURAL WORLD AND THE SPIRIT WORLD
06:23	GROW CLOSER AND CLOSER,
06:25	UNTIL THE LINE BETWEEN THEM
06:27	IS BLURRED COMPLETELY.
06:29	HEI BAI IS ALREADY CAUSING DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION.
06:33	ONCE THE SOLSTICE IS HERE,
06:35	THERE IS NO TELLING WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
06:37	SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO EXACTLY?
06:40	WHO BETTER TO RESOLVE A CRISIS
06:42	BETWEEN OUR WORLD AND THE SPIRIT WORLD
06:45	THAN THE AVATAR HIMSELF?
06:47	YOU ARE THE GREAT BRIDGE
06:49	BETWEEN MAN AND SPIRITS.
06:51	RIGHT. THAT'S ME.
06:54	HEY, GREAT BRIDGE GUY.
06:56	CAN I TALK TO YOU OVER HERE FOR A SECOND?
06:59	AANG, YOU SEEM A LITTLE UNSURE ABOUT ALL THIS.
07:02	YEAH. THAT MIGHT BE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL
07:05	ABOUT THE SPIRIT WORLD.
07:08	IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S SOMEONE TO TEACH ME THIS STUFF.
07:10	SO, CAN YOU HELP THESE PEOPLE?
07:13	I HAVE TO TRY, DON'T I?
07:15	MAYBE WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO WILL JUST...
07:17	COME TO ME.
07:18	[PURRING]
07:20	I THINK YOU CAN DO IT, AANG.
07:23	YEAH.
07:25	WE'RE ALL GONNA GET EATEN BY A SPIRIT MONSTER.
07:33	[SNORING]
07:35	[RUSTLING]
07:37	WHO'S THERE?
07:39	[SQUEAKING]
07:40	A MEADOW VOLE.
07:42	I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
07:44	YOU STARTLED ME, LITTLE ONE.
07:47	[SIGH]
07:49	SEEMS I DOZED OFF AND MISSED MY NEPHEW'S DEADLINE,
07:52	BUT IT WAS A VERY SWEET NAP.
07:55	[SQUEAKING]
08:00	[RUMBLING]
08:04	UHH!
08:08	HE'S A FIRE NATION SOLDIER.
08:09	HE'S NO ORDINARY SOLDIER.
08:12	THIS IS THE FIRE LORD'S BROTHER.
08:14	THE DRAGON OF THE WEST--
08:15	THE ONCE GREAT GENERAL IROH.
08:18	BUT NOW, HE'S OUR PRISONER.
08:32	HELLO? SPIRIT? CAN YOU HEAR ME?
08:35	THIS IS THE AVATAR SPEAKING.
08:38	I'M HERE TO TRY TO HELP STUFF.
08:41	THIS ISN'T RIGHT.
08:42	WE CAN'T SIT HERE AND COWER WHILE AANG
08:44	WAITS FOR SOME MONSTER TO SHOW UP.
08:46	IF ANYONE CAN SAVE US, HE CAN.
08:48	HE STILL SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FACE THIS ALONE.
08:57	THE SUN IS SET.
08:58	WHERE ARE YOU, HEI BAI?
09:01	WELL, SPIRIT, UH,
09:04	I HEREBY ASK YOU
09:06	TO PLEASE LEAVE THIS VILLAGE IN PEACE.
09:11	OK. WELL, I GUESS THAT'S SETTLED, THEN.
09:16	[VOICES WHISPERING]
09:35	YOU MUST BE THE HEI BAI SPIRIT. MY NAME IS--
09:39	[ROARS]
09:45	MY NAME IS AANG. I'M THE AVATAR,
09:47	AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP.
09:48	HEY, WAIT UP!
09:54	[ROARING]
10:01	UH...
10:03	THE AVATAR'S METHODS ARE...
10:05	UNUSUAL.
10:07	IT DOESN'T SEEM TOO INTERESTED
10:08	IN WHAT HE'S SAYING.
10:09	MAYBE WE SHOULD GO HELP HIM.
10:12	NO. ONLY THE AVATAR STANDS A CHANCE AGAINST THE HEI BAI.
10:15	AANG WILL FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT THING TO DO, SOKKA.
10:21	PLEASE, WOULD YOU STOP DESTROYING THINGS AND LISTEN?
10:24	I'M JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB AS SPIRIT BRIDGE.
10:27	EXCUSE ME.
10:28	WOULD YOU PLEASE TURN AROUND?
10:31	I COMMAND YOU TO TURN AROUND NOW!
10:34	UHH!
10:38	THAT'S IT. HE NEEDS HELP.
10:40	SOKKA! WAIT!
10:43	Leader: IT'S NOT SAFE.
10:44	HEI BAI. OVER HERE!
10:50	SOKKA! GO BACK!
10:52	WE'LL FIGHT HIM TOGETHER, AANG.
10:54	I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT HIM UNLESS I--
11:02	SOKKA!
11:10	UNCLE.
11:11	UNCLE, WHERE ARE YOU?
11:13	SIR, MAYBE HE THOUGHT YOU LEFT WITHOUT HIM.
11:15	SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT HERE.
11:18	THAT PILE OF ROCKS.
11:20	IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S BEEN A LANDSLIDE, SIR.
11:22	LAND DOESN'T SLIDE UPHILL.
11:24	THOSE ROCKS DIDN'T MOVE NATURALLY.
11:27	MY UNCLE'S BEEN CAPTURED BY EARTHBENDERS.
11:35	[GASPING]
11:40	Sokka: AANG! OVER HERE!
11:50	HELP!
11:51	HANG ON, SOKKA!
11:55	[GRUNTING]
12:00	AAH!
12:01	UHH!
12:10	SOKKA!
12:14	I'VE FAILED.
12:30	WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?
12:32	WE'RE TAKING YOU TO FACE JUSTICE.
12:34	RIGHT.
12:36	BUT WHERE, SPECIFICALLY?
12:38	A PLACE YOU'RE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH, ACTUALLY.
12:40	YOU ONCE LAID SIEGE TO IT FOR 600 DAYS,
12:44	BUT IT WOULD NOT YIELD TO YOU.
12:46	AH, THE GREAT CITY OF BA SING SE.
12:51	IT WAS GREATER THAN YOU WERE, APPARENTLY.
12:53	I ACKNOWLEDGE MY DEFEAT AT BA SING SE.
12:57	AFTER 600 DAYS AWAY FROM HOME,
13:00	MY MEN WERE TIRED, AND I WAS TIRED.
13:05	[YAWN]
13:07	AND I'M STILL TIRED.
13:30	I'M SURE THEY'LL BE BACK.
13:32	I KNOW.
13:36	YOU SHOULD GET SOME REST.
13:38	EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OK.
13:41	YOUR BROTHER IS IN GOOD HANDS.
13:44	I WOULD BE SHOCKED
13:46	IF THE AVATAR RETURNED WITHOUT HIM.
13:48	KATARA? KATARA, I LOST HIM.
13:54	THE SUN IS RISING.
13:56	PERHAPS HE WILL RETURN SOON.
13:59	WHAT? NO. I'M RIGHT HERE.
14:01	GRR!
14:02	[GRUNTING]
14:10	I'M IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.
14:20	UGH. YEP, THAT'S UNCLE IROH.
14:27	Aang: I'LL FIGURE THIS OUT, KATARA. I PROMISE.
14:30	LIKE THEY SAID, I'M THE BRIDGE
14:31	BETWEEN THE WORLDS, RIGHT?
14:33	ALL I HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHAT I HAVE TO DO,
14:36	BUT ONCE I DO THAT, NO PROBLEM.
14:39	[GROWLING]
14:41	APPA. HEY, BUDDY. I'M RIGHT HERE.
14:44	BUT I GUESS YOU CAN'T SEE ME, EITHER.
14:47	[DULL ROAR]
14:49	IT'S OK, APPA. DON'T WORRY.
14:51	I'M SURE THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY BACK.
14:53	I BET THEY EVEN FOUND YOU A BUNCH OF MOON PEACHES,
14:55	FOR A TREAT.
14:58	WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
15:01	AVATAR ROKU, HOW CAN I TALK TO YOU?
15:06	SOKKA?
15:12	[GROWLING]
15:13	THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT SOKKA.
15:18	UHH!
15:25	WHAT?
15:27	I CAN'T AIRBEND IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.
15:32	[GROWLING]
15:38	[GROWLING]
15:45	YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE SOKKA IS, DO YOU?
15:50	[WHIMPERING]
15:57	YOU'RE AVATAR ROKU'S ANIMAL GUIDE,
16:00	LIKE APPA IS TO ME.
16:02	I NEED TO SAVE MY FRIEND, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW.
16:04	IS THERE SOME WAY FOR ME TO TALK TO ROKU?
16:11	I'LL BE BACK, KATARA.
16:14	TAKE ME TO ROKU.
16:27	[GASP]
16:31	OH.
16:33	WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
16:35	NOTHING.
16:36	ACTUALLY, THERE IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM.
16:40	MY OLD JOINTS ARE FEELING SORE AND ACHY,
16:43	AND THESE SHACKLES ARE TOO LOOSE.
16:46	TOO LOOSE?
16:47	THAT'S RIGHT. THE CUFFS ARE LOOSE,
16:49	AND THEY JANGLE AROUND AND BUMP MY WRISTS.
16:53	IT WOULD HELP ME IF YOU WOULD TIGHTEN THEM
16:55	SO THEY WOULDN'T SHAKE AROUND SO MUCH.
16:58	VERY WELL.
17:00	CORPORAL, TIGHTEN THE PRISONER'S HANDCUFFS.
17:07	AAH!
17:10	AAH!
17:13	AAH!
17:29	Aang: HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
17:30	AAH!
17:38	I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
17:40	THIS IS JUST A STATUE OF ROKU.
17:51	IS THAT WHAT ROKU WANTS TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?
17:54	A COMET?
17:56	WHEN CAN I TALK TO HIM?
17:58	[GROWLING]
18:25	IT'S A CALENDAR,
18:27	AND THE LIGHT WILL REACH ROKU ON THE SOLSTICE.
18:30	SO THAT'S WHEN I'LL BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO ROKU?
18:32	[GROWLING]
18:34	BUT I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.
18:35	I NEED TO SAVE SOKKA NOW!
18:40	UGH! UHH!
18:43	HYAH!
18:51	HE IS TOO DANGEROUS, CAPTAIN.
18:54	WE CAN'T JUST CARRY HIM TO THE CAPITAL.
18:56	WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING NOW.
18:57	I AGREE.
18:59	HE MUST BE DEALT WITH IMMEDIATELY
19:00	AND SEVERELY.
19:02	PTOH!
19:06	Katara: IT'S NO USE, APPA. I DON'T SEE THEM ANYWHERE.
19:09	OUR BEST HOPE IS TO GO BACK TO THE VILLAGE AND WAIT.
19:12	[APPA GROWLS]
19:19	THE AVATAR.
19:33	WHOA.
19:35	AAH!
20:05	YOU'RE BACK!
20:08	WHERE'S SOKKA?
20:10	I'M NOT SURE.
20:17	Captain: THESE DANGEROUS HANDS MUST BE CRUSHED.
20:20	[GRUNTING]
20:25	HYAH!
20:29	HYAH!
20:30	EXCELLENT FORM, PRINCE ZUKO.
20:33	YOU TAUGHT ME WELL.
20:34	Captain: SURRENDER YOURSELVES.
20:35	IT'S 5 AGAINST 2.
20:37	YOU'RE CLEARLY OUTNUMBERED.
20:39	UH, THAT'S TRUE,
20:41	BUT YOU ARE CLEARLY OUTMATCHED.
20:44	HY...AH!
20:46	YAH!
20:46	YAH!
20:50	HYAH! HYAH!
20:54	[GRUNTING]
20:56	HYAH!
20:57	UHH!
20:57	UHH!
21:03	UHH!
21:04	UHH! UHH!
21:09	YAH!
21:13	OH!
21:15	[SOLDIERS GROANING]
21:21	NOW, WOULD YOU PLEASE PUT ON SOME CLOTHES?
21:24	[VOICES WHISPERING]
21:36	[CHIMING]
21:44	AAH!
21:46	AANG! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
21:48	RUN!
21:49	[ROARING]
22:04	[ROARING]
22:06	YOU'RE THE SPIRIT OF THIS FOREST.
22:08	NOW I UNDERSTAND.
22:10	YOU'RE UPSET AND ANGRY
22:12	BECAUSE YOUR HOME WAS BURNED DOWN.
22:14	WHEN I SAW THE FOREST HAD BURNED,
22:16	I WAS SAD AND UPSET,
22:17	BUT MY FRIEND GAVE ME HOPE
22:19	THAT THE FOREST WOULD GROW BACK.
22:40	SOKKA!
22:43	WHAT HAPPENED?
22:45	YOU WERE TRAPPED IN THE SPIRIT WORLD FOR 24 HOURS.
22:48	HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
22:49	LIKE I SERIOUSLY NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM.
22:53	THANK YOU, AVATAR.
22:55	IF ONLY THERE WERE A WAY
22:57	TO REPAY YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
22:59	YOU COULD GIVE US SOME SUPPLIES AND SOME MONEY.
23:01	SOKKA.
23:01	WHAT?
23:03	WE NEED STUFF.
23:05	IT WOULD BE AN HONOR TO HELP YOU PREPARE FOR YOUR JOURNEY.
23:09	I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, AANG.
23:11	YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO ALL ON YOUR OWN.
23:13	ACTUALLY, I DID HAVE A LITTLE HELP.
23:16	AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.
23:21	WHAT IS IT?
23:22	I NEED TO TALK TO ROKU,
23:23	AND I THINK I FOUND A WAY
23:25	TO CONTACT HIS SPIRIT.
23:27	THAT'S GREAT.
23:27	CREEPY, BUT GREAT.
23:29	THERE'S A TEMPLE ON A CRESCENT-SHAPED ISLAND,
23:31	AND IF I GO THERE ON THE SOLSTICE,
23:33	I'LL BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH HIM.
23:35	BUT THE SOLSTICE IS TOMORROW.
23:37	YEAH, AND THERE'S ONE MORE PROBLEM.
23:39	THE ISLAND IS IN THE FIRE NATION.
