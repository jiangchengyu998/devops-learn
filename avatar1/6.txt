00:10	Katara, voice-over: WATER.	
00:11	EARTH.	
00:13	FIRE.	
00:15	AIR.	
00:17	LONG AGO, THE FOUR NATIONS LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.	
00:21	THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.	
00:25	ONLY THE AVATAR, MASTER OF ALL FOUR ELEMENTS,	
00:28	COULD STOP THEM.	
00:30	BUT WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED HIM MOST,	
00:32	HE VANISHED.	
00:34	A HUNDRED YEARS PASSED, AND MY BROTHER AND I	
00:36	DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR, AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG.	
00:39	AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING SKILLS WERE GREAT,	
00:41	HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN BEFORE HE'S READY TO SAVE ANYONE.	
00:45	BUT I BELIEVE AANG CAN SAVE THE WORLD.	
00:58	IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE I'VE HAD HOPE,	
01:01	BUT YOU BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE, MY LITTLE WATERBENDER.	
01:04	AANG IS THE AVATAR.	
01:07	YOU BOTH FOUND HIM FOR A REASON.	
01:09	NOW YOUR DESTINIES ARE INTERTWINED WITH HIS.	
01:13	ACCORDING TO LEGEND, YOU NEED TO FIRST MASTER WATER,	
01:16	THEN EARTH, THEN FIRE, RIGHT?	
01:18	THAT'S WHAT THE MONKS TOLD ME.	
01:19	WELL, IF WE GO TO THE NORTH POLE,	
01:22	YOU CAN MASTER WATERBENDING.	
01:23	WE COULD LEARN IT TOGETHER!	
01:26	THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE SIGHTINGS OF THE AVATAR,	
01:29	BUT HE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACK DOWN.	
01:32	THIS COWARD'S HUNDRED YEARS IN HIDING ARE OVER.	
01:40	[BIRDS SINGING]	
01:51	[MOMO CHATTERING]	
01:54	GREAT. YOU'RE BACK. WHAT'S FOR DINNER?	
01:57	WE'VE GOT A FEW OPTIONS.	
01:59	FIRST, ROUND NUTS AND SOME KIND OF OVAL-SHAPED NUTS.	
02:02	AND SOME ROCK-SHAPED NUTS THAT MIGHT JUST BE ROCKS.	
02:08	DIG IN.	
02:09	SERIOUSLY, WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?	
02:13	[PURRING]	
02:19	[BOOM]	
02:20	Sokka: WHAT WAS THAT?	
02:25	[BOOM]	
02:27	Aang: IT'S COMING FROM OVER THERE.	
02:30	Sokka: SHOULDN'T WE RUN AWAY FROM HUGE BOOMS, NOT TOWARD THEM?	
02:36	[PURRING]	
02:43	HYAH.	
02:45	AN EARTHBENDER.	
02:46	LET'S GO MEET HIM.	
02:48	HE LOOKS DANGEROUS, SO WE BETTER APPROACH CAUTIOUSLY.	
02:50	HELLO THERE! I'M KATARA.	
02:52	WHAT'S YOUR NAME?	
02:54	AH!	
03:01	Aang: NICE TO MEET YOU!	
03:04	I JUST WANTED TO SAY HI.	
03:06	HEY, THAT GUY'S GOT TO BE RUNNING SOMEWHERE.	
03:08	MAYBE WE'RE NEAR A VILLAGE.	
03:10	AND I BET THAT VILLAGE HAS A MARKET.	
03:13	WHICH MEANS NO NUTS FOR DINNER.	
03:15	HEY! I WORKED HARD TO GET THOSE NUTS.	
03:17	[PURRING]	
03:18	YEAH, I HATE THEM, TOO.	
03:27	Aang: GREAT HAT.	
03:30	I'LL TRADE YOU SOME NUTS FOR IT.	
03:34	HEY!	
03:37	HI, MOM.	
03:38	WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, HARU?	
03:40	YOU'RE LATE!	
03:41	GET STARTED ON YOUR CHORES.	
03:43	HEY! YOU'RE THAT KID.	
03:44	AH!	
03:46	WHY DID YOU RUN AWAY BEFORE?	
03:48	UH...YOU MUST HAVE ME CONFUSED WITH SOME OTHER KID.	
03:50	NO, SHE DOESN'T. WE SAW YOU EARTHBENDING.	
03:54	THEY SAW YOU DOING WHAT?	
03:56	THEY'RE CRAZY, MOM.	
03:58	I MEAN, LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE DRESSED.	
04:01	YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THAT IS.	
04:04	YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY CAUGHT YOU EARTHBENDING.	
04:07	Man: OPEN UP!	
04:08	[LOUD KNOCKING]	
04:10	Sokka: FIRE NATION. ACT NATURAL.	
04:22	AAH!	
04:24	WHAT DO YOU WANT? I'VE ALREADY PAID YOU THIS WEEK.	
04:27	THE TAX JUST DOUBLED.	
04:29	WE WOULDN'T WANT AN ACCIDENT, WOULD WE?	
04:31	FIRE IS SOMETIMES SO HARD TO CONTROL.	
04:43	YOU CAN KEEP THE COPPER ONES.	
04:50	NICE GUY.	
04:52	HOW LONG HAS THE FIRE NATION BEEN HERE?	
04:54	FIVE YEARS. FIRE LORD OZAI	
04:57	USES OUR TOWN'S COAL MINES TO FUEL HIS SHIPS.	
04:59	THEY'RE THUGS. THEY STEAL FROM US.	
05:02	AND EVERYONE HERE IS TOO MUCH OF A COWARD	
05:04	TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.	
05:05	QUIET, HARU!	
05:06	DON'T TALK LIKE THAT!	
05:08	BUT HARU'S AN EARTHBENDER.	
05:09	HE CAN HELP.	
05:11	EARTHBENDING IS FORBIDDEN.	
05:12	IT'S CAUSED NOTHING BUT MISERY FOR THIS VILLAGE.	
05:15	HE MUST NEVER USE HIS ABILITIES.	
05:17	HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?	
05:19	HARU HAS A GIFT.	
05:21	ASKING HIM NOT TO EARTHBEND	
05:22	IS LIKE ASKING ME NOT TO WATERBEND.	
05:25	IT'S A PART OF WHO WE ARE.	
05:26	YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.	
05:28	I UNDERSTAND THAT HARU CAN HELP YOU FIGHT BACK.	
05:31	WHAT CAN THE FIRE NATION DO TO YOU	
05:33	THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE ALREADY?	
05:34	THEY COULD TAKE HARU AWAY,	
05:37	LIKE THEY TOOK HIS FATHER.	
05:47	Haru: MY MOM SAID YOU CAN SLEEP HERE TONIGHT.	
05:49	BUT YOU SHOULD LEAVE IN THE MORNING.	
05:51	THANKS. I'LL MAKE SURE APPA DOESN'T EAT ALL YOUR HAY.	
05:59	Katara: I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID EARLIER.	
06:02	I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR FATHER.	
06:03	Haru: THAT'S OK.	
06:05	IT'S FUNNY. THE WAY YOU WERE TALKING BACK IN THE STORE,	
06:08	IT REMINDED ME OF HIM.	
06:10	THANKS.	
06:11	MY FATHER WAS VERY COURAGEOUS.	
06:13	WHEN THE FIRE NATION INVADED,	
06:15	HE AND THE OTHER EARTHBENDERS WERE OUTNUMBERED 10 TO 1.	
06:18	BUT THEY FOUGHT BACK ANYWAY.	
06:19	HE SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT MAN.	
06:21	AFTER THE ATTACK, THEY ROUNDED UP MY FATHER	
06:25	AND EVERY OTHER EARTHBENDER	
06:27	AND TOOK THEM AWAY. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM SINCE.	
06:30	SO THAT'S WHY YOU HIDE YOUR EARTHBENDING.	
06:32	YEAH.	
06:33	THE PROBLEM IS,	
06:35	THE ONLY WAY I CAN FEEL CLOSE TO MY FATHER NOW	
06:38	IS WHEN I PRACTICE MY BENDING.	
06:42	HE TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I KNOW.	
06:44	SEE THIS NECKLACE?	
06:48	MY MOTHER GAVE IT TO ME.	
06:49	IT'S BEAUTIFUL.	
06:51	I LOST MY MOTHER IN A FIRE NATION RAID.	
06:53	THIS NECKLACE IS ALL I HAVE LEFT OF HER.	
06:55	IT'S NOT ENOUGH, IS IT?	
06:57	NO.	
07:04	AAH! HELP!	
07:05	THE MINE!	
07:06	AAH...	
07:09	HELP ME!	
07:12	[MOANING]	
07:14	[RUMBLING]	
07:17	AH! IT'S NOT WORKING.	
07:19	WE HAVE TO GET HELP.	
07:21	THERE'S NO TIME. PULL HARDER!	
07:23	HARU, THERE'S A WAY YOU CAN HELP HIM.	
07:25	I CAN'T.	
07:27	PLEASE. THERE'S NO ONE AROUND TO SEE YOU.	
07:29	IT'S THE ONLY WAY!	
07:40	AH!	
07:43	HARU, YOU DID IT!	
07:51	[PURRING]	
07:53	IT WAS SO BRAVE OF HARU TO USE HIS EARTHBENDING	
07:56	TO HELP THAT OLD MAN.	
07:58	YOU MUST HAVE REALLY INSPIRED HIM.	
08:00	I GUESS SO.	
08:01	EVERYONE SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP.	
08:03	WE'RE LEAVING AT DAWN.	
08:04	DAWN? CAN'T WE SLEEP IN FOR ONCE?	
08:05	ABSOLUTELY NOT!	
08:07	THIS VILLAGE IS CRAWLING WITH FIRE NATION TROOPS.	
08:09	IF THEY DISCOVER YOU'RE HERE, AANG,	
08:11	WE'LL BE EATING FIREBALLS FOR BREAKFAST.	
08:13	GOOD NIGHT.	
08:14	I'D RATHER EAT FIREBALLS THAN NUTS.	
08:16	GOOD NIGHT.	
08:17	[LAUGHING]	
08:40	AH!	
08:41	THAT'S HIM!	
08:42	THAT'S THE EARTHBENDER!	
08:44	AAH!	
09:13	THEY TOOK HIM!	
09:15	THEY TOOK HARU AWAY!	
09:15	WHAT?	
09:17	THE OLD MAN TURNED HIM IN TO THE FIRE NATION.	
09:19	IT'S ALL MY FAULT. I FORCED HIM INTO EARTHBENDING.	
09:22	SLOW DOWN, KATARA. WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?	
09:25	HARU'S MOTHER SAID THEY CAME FOR HIM AT MIDNIGHT.	
09:27	THEN IT'S TOO LATE TO TRACK HIM. HE'S LONG GONE.	
09:29	WE DON'T NEED TO TRACK HIM.	
09:31	THE FIRE NATION IS GOING TO	
09:32	TAKE ME RIGHT TO HARU.	
09:33	AND WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?	
09:36	BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO ARREST ME FOR EARTHBENDING.	
09:42	I THOUGHT YOU WERE CRAZY AT FIRST, KATARA,	
09:44	BUT THIS MIGHT WORK.	
09:46	THERE ARE VENTILATION SHAFTS THROUGHOUT THESE MINES.	
09:47	ALL AANG HAS TO DO IS SEND AN AIR CURRENT	
09:49	FROM THAT VENT TO THIS ONE RIGHT HERE.	
09:51	THE BOULDER LEVITATES AND TA-DA--	
09:53	FAKE EARTHBENDING.	
09:55	AANG, DID YOU GET ALL THAT?	
09:57	SURE, SURE. I GOT IT.	
09:58	DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR CUE?	
10:00	YEAH, YEAH. JUST RELAX.	
10:02	YOU'RE TAKING ALL THE FUN OUT OF THIS.	
10:04	BY "THIS" DO YOU MEAN INTENTIONALLY BEING CAPTURED	
10:07	BY AN ARMY OF RUTHLESS FIREBENDERS?	
10:09	EXACTLY. THAT'S FUN STUFF.	
10:11	Sokka: HERE THEY COME. GET IN YOUR PLACES.	
10:15	UH! GET OUT OF MY WAY, PIPSQUEAK.	
10:18	HOW DARE YOU CALL ME PIPSQUEAK,	
10:21	YOU GIANT-EARED CRETIN?	
10:23	WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?	
10:25	A GIANT-EARED CRETIN.	
10:27	LOOK AT THOSE THINGS.	
10:29	DO HERDS OF ANIMALS USE THEM FOR SHADE?	
10:31	YOU BETTER BACK OFF!	
10:33	SERIOUSLY, BACK OFF.	
10:34	I WILL NOT BACK OFF!	
10:36	I BET ELEPHANTS GET TOGETHER	
10:38	AND MAKE FUN OF HOW LARGE YOUR EARS ARE.	
10:41	THAT'S IT! YOU'RE GOING DOWN.	
10:43	I'LL SHOW YOU WHO'S BOSS,	
10:46	EARTHBENDING STYLE.	
10:51	I SAID, "EARTHBENDING STYLE!"	
10:59	THAT LEMUR. HE'S EARTHBENDING.	
11:03	NO, YOU IDIOT. IT'S THE GIRL.	
11:06	OH. OF COURSE.	
11:08	I'LL HOLD HER!	
11:11	[WHISPERING] YOU'VE GOT 12 HOURS TO FIND HARU.	
11:13	WE'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.	
11:22	MOMO, YOU HAVE SOME BIG EARS.	
11:25	[PURRING]	
12:03	SHE'LL BE FINE, AANG. KATARA KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.	
12:15	Man: EARTHBENDERS, IT IS MY PLEASURE TO WELCOME YOU	
12:18	ABOARD MY MODEST SHIPYARD.	
12:21	I AM YOUR WARDEN.	
12:23	I PREFER TO THINK OF YOU NOT AS PRISONERS,	
12:26	BUT AS HONORED GUESTS.	
12:29	AND I HOPE YOU COME TO THINK OF ME	
12:32	AS YOUR HUMBLE AND CARING HOST.	
12:35	YOU WILL SUCCEED HERE IF YOU SIMPLY ABIDE--	
12:38	[COUGHING]	
12:40	HYAH!	
12:44	WHAT KIND OF GUEST DISHONORS HIS HOST BY INTERRUPTING HIM?	
12:48	TAKE HIM BELOW.	
12:50	ONE WEEK IN SOLITARY WILL IMPROVE HIS MANNERS.	
12:54	SIMPLY TREAT ME WITH THE COURTESY I GIVE YOU	
12:57	AND WE'LL GET ALONG FAMOUSLY.	
13:01	YOU WILL NOTICE, EARTHBENDERS,	
13:04	THAT THIS RIG IS MADE ENTIRELY OF METAL.	
13:07	YOU ARE MILES AWAY FROM ANY ROCK OR EARTH.	
13:11	SO, IF YOU HAVE ANY ILLUSIONS ABOUT EMPLOYING	
13:14	THAT BRUTISH SAVAGERY THAT PASSES FOR BENDING	
13:17	AMONG YOU PEOPLE, FORGET THEM.	
13:21	IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.	
13:24	GOOD DAY.	
13:51	KATARA?	
13:53	HARU!	
13:54	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?	
13:56	IT'S MY FAULT YOU WERE CAPTURED.	
13:57	I CAME TO RESCUE YOU.	
13:59	SO YOU GOT YOURSELF ARRESTED?	
14:01	IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO FIND YOU.	
14:03	YOU'VE GOT GUTS, KATARA. I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.	
14:06	COME ON. THERE'S SOMEONE I WANT YOU TO MEET.	
14:09	KATARA, THIS IS MY FATHER, TYRO.	
14:14	DAD, THIS IS KATARA.	
14:16	IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.	
14:18	HAVE SOME DINNER, KATARA.	
14:21	EW.	
14:24	IT'S NOT AS BAD AS IT LOOKS.	
14:28	EEW!	
14:29	IT'S STILL PRETTY BAD, THOUGH.	
14:31	TYRO, THE PRISONERS ARE COMPLAINING	
14:33	THERE AREN'T ENOUGH BLANKETS TO GO AROUND.	
14:35	I'LL TALK TO THE GUARDS.	
14:37	IN THE MEANTIME, MAKE SURE THE ELDERLY ARE TAKEN CARE OF.	
14:39	THE REST OF US WILL SIMPLY HAVE TO HOPE FOR WARMER WEATHER.	
14:43	IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING,	
14:44	WHAT'S YOUR ESCAPE PLAN?	
14:45	EXCUSE ME?	
14:47	YOU KNOW, THE PLAN TO GET EVERYONE OFF THE RIG?	
14:49	WHAT IS IT? MUTINY, SABOTAGE?	
14:51	THE PLAN? THE PLAN IS TO SURVIVE,	
14:54	WAIT OUT THIS WAR, HOPE THAT ONE DAY	
14:57	SOME OF US CAN GET BACK HOME AND FORGET THIS EVER HAPPENED.	
15:00	HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?	
15:01	YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'VE ALREADY GIVEN UP.	
15:03	KATARA, I ADMIRE YOUR COURAGE.	
15:06	AND I ENVY YOUR YOUTH.	
15:08	BUT PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT STAKE HERE.	
15:11	THE WARDEN IS A RUTHLESS MAN,	
15:13	AND HE WON'T STAND FOR ANY REBELLION.	
15:16	I'M SORRY, BUT WE'RE POWERLESS.	
15:19	WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.	
15:24	EARTHBENDERS!	
15:26	YOU DON'T KNOW ME, BUT I KNOW OF YOU.	
15:29	EVERY CHILD IN MY WATER TRIBE VILLAGE WAS ROCKED TO SLEEP	
15:33	WITH STORIES OF THE BRAVE EARTH KINGDOM	
15:35	AND THE COURAGEOUS EARTHBENDERS WHO GUARD ITS BORDERS.	
15:38	SOME OF YOU MAY THINK THAT THE FIRE NATION	
15:40	HAS MADE YOU POWERLESS.	
15:43	YES. THEY HAVE TAKEN AWAY YOUR ABILITY TO BEND.	
15:45	BUT THEY CAN'T TAKE AWAY YOUR COURAGE.	
15:48	AND IT IS YOUR COURAGE THEY SHOULD TRULY FEAR,	
15:50	BECAUSE IT RUNS DEEPER THAN ANY MINE	
15:53	YOU'VE BEEN FORCED TO DIG,	
15:55	ANY OCEAN THAT KEEPS YOU FAR FROM HOME.	
15:57	IT IS THE STRENGTH OF YOUR HEARTS	
15:59	THAT MAKE YOU WHO YOU ARE,	
16:01	HEARTS THAT WILL REMAIN UNBROKEN WHEN ALL ROCK AND STONE	
16:04	HAS ERODED AWAY.	
16:05	THE TIME TO FIGHT BACK IS NOW!	
16:08	I CAN TELL YOU THE AVATAR HAS RETURNED!	
16:11	SO REMEMBER YOUR COURAGE, EARTHBENDERS!	
16:13	LET US FIGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM!	
16:17	[MAN COUGHING]	
16:50	AH!	
16:51	SHH.	
16:56	YOUR 12 HOURS ARE UP. WHERE IS HARU?	
16:57	WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.	
16:59	I CAN'T.	
17:01	WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. THERE ARE GUARDS EVERYWHERE.	
17:03	GET ON!	
17:05	KATARA, WHAT'S WRONG?	
17:06	I'M NOT LEAVING.	
17:08	I'M NOT GIVING UP ON THESE PEOPLE.	
17:16	Sokka: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'RE NOT LEAVING?	
17:19	WE CAN'T ABANDON THESE PEOPLE.	
17:20	THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO HELP THEM.	
17:22	MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU SAY, SOKKA?	
17:25	I SAY YOU'RE BOTH CRAZY.	
17:29	LAST CHANCE. WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW.	
17:31	NO.	
17:33	I HATE WHEN YOU GET LIKE THIS.	
17:35	COME ON, WE BETTER HIDE.	
17:38	[WHISPERING] GO.	
17:44	LOOK!	
17:46	TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW.	
17:49	WELL, SIR, IT LOOKED LIKE A FLYING BISON.	
17:51	WHAT?	
17:53	IT WAS A GIANT, FLYING BUFFALO, SIR,	
17:54	WITH AN EMPTY SADDLE.	
17:56	WHICH WAS IT, A BUFFALO OR A BISON?	
17:58	I-I-I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS,	
18:01	BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT, IS IT, SIR?	
18:03	I'LL DECIDE WHAT THE POINT IS, FOOL!	
18:06	AAH!	
18:08	[SPLASH]	
18:10	YOU! WAKE UP THE CAPTAIN! SEARCH THE ENTIRE RIG!	
18:13	SIR.	
18:15	WHAT?	
18:16	THAT WAS THE CAPTAIN YOU JUST THREW OVERBOARD, SO--	
18:19	THEN WAKE UP SOMEONE I HAVEN'T THROWN OVERBOARD	
18:22	AND SEARCH THE RIG.	
18:24	THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE, AND I DON'T LIKE IT.	
18:30	[PURRING]	
18:33	WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?	
18:37	I WISH I KNEW HOW TO MAKE A HURRICANE.	
18:40	THE WARDEN WOULD RUN AWAY, AND WE WOULD STEAL HIS KEYS.	
18:42	WOULDN'T HE JUST TAKE HIS KEYS WITH HIM?	
18:45	I'M JUST TOSSING IDEAS AROUND.	
18:47	I TRIED TALKING THE EARTHBENDERS	
18:48	INTO FIGHTING BACK, BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.	
18:51	IF THERE WAS JUST A WAY TO HELP THEM HELP THEMSELVES.	
18:54	FOR THAT THEY NEED SOME KIND OF EARTH OR SOME ROCK,	
18:58	SOMETHING THEY CAN BEND.	
19:00	BUT THIS ENTIRE PLACE IS MADE OF METAL.	
19:04	NO, IT'S NOT. LOOK AT THE SMOKE.	
19:06	I BET THEY'RE BURNING COAL.	
19:09	IN OTHER WORDS...	
19:11	EARTH.	
19:16	IT'S ALMOST DAWN. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.	
19:18	YOU SURE THIS IS GONNA WORK?	
19:20	IT SHOULD.	
19:22	THESE VENTS REMINDED ME OF OUR LITTLE TRICK	
19:23	BACK AT THE VILLAGE.	
19:25	WE'RE GONNA DO THE SAME THING,	
19:26	BUT ON A MUCH BIGGER SCALE.	
19:28	THERE'S A HUGE DEPOSIT OF COAL AT THE BASE OF THIS ISLAND.	
19:30	AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS VENTILATED.	
19:32	AANG CLOSED OFF ALL THE VENTS EXCEPT ONE.	
19:34	WHEN HE DOES HIS AIRBENDING,	
19:36	THE COAL ONLY HAS ONE PLACE TO GO--	
19:38	RIGHT BACK HERE.	
19:39	Man: THERE'S THE INTRUDER!	
19:41	STAY BACK! I'M WARNING YOU!	
19:43	KATARA, STOP. YOU CAN'T WIN THIS FIGHT.	
19:48	LISTEN TO HIM WELL, CHILD.	
19:51	YOU'RE ONE MISTAKE AWAY	
19:53	FROM DYING WHERE YOU STAND.	
20:13	[COUGHING]	
20:16	HERE'S YOUR CHANCE, EARTHBENDERS!	
20:18	TAKE IT! YOUR FATE IS IN YOUR OWN HANDS!	
20:25	[WARDEN LAUGHING]	
20:29	FOOLISH GIRL.	
20:31	YOU THOUGHT A FEW INSPIRATIONAL WORDS	
20:34	AND SOME COAL WOULD CHANGE THESE PEOPLE?	
20:38	LOOK AT THESE BLANK HOPELESS FACES.	
20:42	THEIR SPIRITS WERE BROKEN A LONG TIME AGO.	
20:45	OH, BUT YOU STILL BELIEVED IN THEM.	
20:48	HOW SWEET.	
20:51	THEY'RE A WASTE OF YOUR ENERGY, LITTLE GIRL.	
20:54	YOU FAILED.	
21:01	GRR.	
21:04	HYAH!	
21:11	SHOW NO MERCY!	
21:15	AAH!	
21:17	FOR THE EARTH KINGDOM,	
21:18	ATTACK!	
21:20	[ALL YELLING]	
21:51	[SCREAMING]	
21:55	GET TO THE SHIP! WE'LL HOLD THEM OFF!	
21:57	DO NOT LET THEM ESCAPE!	
22:02	GUYS, THROW ME SOME COAL!	
22:18	NO, PLEASE. I CAN'T SWIM.	
22:22	DON'T WORRY. I HEAR COWARDS FLOAT.	
22:27	[SCREAMING]	
22:34	I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME,	
22:37	FOR SAVING US.	
22:39	ALL IT TOOK WAS A LITTLE COAL.	
22:41	IT WASN'T THE COAL, KATARA.	
22:43	IT WAS YOU.	
22:45	THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME FIND MY COURAGE,	
22:48	KATARA OF THE WATER TRIBE.	
22:49	MY FAMILY AND EVERYONE HERE	
22:52	OWES YOU MUCH.	
22:54	SO, I GUESS YOU'RE GOING HOME NOW.	
22:57	YES, TO TAKE BACK MY VILLAGE.	
22:59	TO TAKE BACK ALL OF OUR VILLAGES!	
23:02	THE FIRE NATION WILL REGRET THE DAY	
23:04	THEY SET FOOT ON OUR LAND!	
23:06	[CHEERING]	
23:07	COME WITH US.	
23:08	I CAN'T.
