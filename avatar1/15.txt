00:09	Katara: WATER...
00:11	EARTH...
00:13	FIRE...
00:15	AIR.
00:17	LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.
00:21	THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.
00:26	ONLY THE AVATAR, MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,
00:28	COULD STOP THEM.
00:30	BUT WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED HIM MOST,
00:31	HE VANISHED.
00:33	A HUNDRED YEARS PASSED,
00:35	AND MY BROTHER AND I DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR,
00:37	AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG,
00:39	AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING SKILLS ARE GREAT,
00:41	HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN BEFORE HE'S READY TO SAVE ANYONE.
00:45	BUT I BELIEVE AANG CAN SAVE THE WORLD.
00:57	100 YEARS HAVE PASSED,
00:58	AND THE FIRE NATION IS NEARING VICTORY IN THE WAR.
01:02	TWO YEARS AGO, MY FATHER AND THE MEN OF MY TRIBE
01:04	JOURNEYED TO THE EARTH KINGDOM
01:06	TO HELP FIGHT AGAINST THE FIRE NATION,
01:08	LEAVING ME AND MY BROTHER TO LOOK AFTER OUR TRIBE.
01:11	TRY TO UNDERSTAND,
01:13	I NEED TO CAPTURE HIM TO RESTORE SOMETHING I'VE LOST--
01:15	MY HONOR.
01:17	PERHAPS IN EXCHANGE,
01:18	I CAN RESTORE SOMETHING YOU'VE LOST.
01:21	MY MOTHER'S NECKLACE.
01:39	HEY, LOOK! A SWORD MADE OUT OF A WHALE'S TOOTH!
01:41	LET ME SEE THAT.
01:53	THIS IS A WATER TRIBE WEAPON.
01:55	SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING ELSE.
01:58	DID SOMEONE LOSE SOMETHING?
01:59	NO, WE FOUND SOMETHING.
02:04	IT'S BURNED.
02:06	THERE WAS A BATTLE.
02:08	WATER TRIBE WARRIORS AMBUSHED A GROUP OF FIREBENDERS.
02:11	THE FIREBENDERS FOUGHT BACK,
02:13	BUT THE WARRIORS DROVE THEM DOWN THIS HILL.
02:21	SO THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
02:23	I DON'T KNOW. THE TRAIL ENDS HERE.
02:25	WAIT! LOOK!
02:27	IT'S ONE OF OUR BOATS!
02:30	Katara: IS THIS DAD'S BOAT?
02:32	NO, BUT IT'S FROM HIS FLEET.
02:35	DAD WAS HERE.
02:39	AHH!
02:41	SEE, PRINCE ZUKO?
02:43	A MOMENT OF QUIET IS GOOD FOR YOUR MENTAL WELL-BEING.
02:48	UNH!
02:50	[GRUNTS]
02:51	WATCH OUT!
02:52	[GROWLING]
02:53	GET BACK!
02:55	WE'RE AFTER A STOWAWAY.
02:56	THERE ARE NO STOWAWAYS ON MY SHIP.
03:07	[MAN BREATHING HEAVILY]
03:13	HE'S PARALYZED.
03:15	ONLY TEMPORARILY.
03:16	THE TOXINS WILL WEAR OFF IN ABOUT AN HOUR,
03:18	BUT BY THEN, HE'LL BE IN JAIL
03:19	AND I'LL HAVE MY MONEY.
03:21	BUT HOW DID YOU FIND HIM ON MY SHIP?
03:23	MY XIERXU CAN SMELL A RAT A CONTINENT AWAY.
03:26	WELL, I'M IMPRESSED.
03:32	VERY IMPRESSED.
03:54	SOKKA.
03:55	I'M COMING WITH YOU.
03:57	YOU'RE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO GO TO WAR, SOKKA.
03:58	YOU KNOW THAT.
03:59	I'M STRONG. I'M BRAVE.
04:01	I CAN FIGHT!
04:03	PLEASE, DAD?
04:05	BEING A MAN IS KNOWING WHERE YOU'RE NEEDED THE MOST,
04:08	AND FOR YOU RIGHT NOW, THAT'S HERE PROTECTING YOUR SISTER.
04:11	I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
04:13	SOMEDAY YOU WILL.
04:16	I'M GONNA MISS YOU SO MUCH.
04:18	[SOBBING]
04:24	WHO'S THERE?
04:27	SOKKA?
04:28	BATO?
04:29	WHO THE WHAT NOW?
04:30	BATO!
04:32	SAKKO! KATARA!
04:34	IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU TWO.
04:37	OH. YOU'VE GROWN SO MUCH.
04:39	HI. I'M AANG.
04:41	WHERE'S DAD?
04:41	IS HE HERE?
04:42	NO. HE AND THE OTHER WARRIORS
04:44	SHOULD BE IN THE EASTERN EARTH KINGDOM BY NOW.
04:47	[WIND BLOWING]
04:49	[SHUDDER]
04:50	THIS IS NO PLACE FOR A REUNION.
04:51	LET'S GET INSIDE.
04:58	AFTER I WAS WOUNDED,
05:00	YOUR FATHER CARRIED ME TO THIS ABBEY.
05:03	THE SISTERS HAVE CARED FOR ME EVER SINCE.
05:06	SUPERIOR, THESE ARE KOTA'S CHILDREN.
05:08	THEY'VE BEEN TRAVELING WITH THE AVATAR.
05:10	I FOUND THEM BY MY BOAT.
05:12	YOUNG AVATAR, IT GIVES ME GREAT JOY
05:14	TO BE IN YOUR PRESENCE.
05:16	WELCOME TO OUR ABBEY.
05:18	THANK YOU. IT'S TRULY AN HONOR TO BE HERE.
05:21	IF THERE'S ANYTHING--
05:22	WHAT SMELLS SO GOOD, BATO?
05:23	[SNIFFS]
05:25	THE SISTERS CRAFT OINTMENTS AND PERFUMES.
05:27	PERFUME?
05:29	MAYBE WE COULD DUMP SOME ON APPA,
05:30	BECAUSE HE STINKS SO MUCH.
05:32	AM I RIGHT?
05:34	[PERSON COUGHS]
05:36	YOU HAVE YOUR FATHER'S WIT.
05:39	BATO, IT LOOKS LIKE HOME!
05:41	EVERYTHING'S HERE, EVEN THE PELTS.
05:44	YEAH. NOTHING'S COZIER THAN DEAD ANIMAL SKINS.
05:50	ACK!
05:54	NO WAY! STEWED SEA PRUNES?
05:57	HELP YOURSELF.
05:59	DAD COULD EAT A WHOLE BARREL OF THESE THINGS.
06:02	[SNIFFS]
06:03	UGH!
06:05	BATO, IS IT TRUE YOU AND DAD LASSOED AN ARCTIC HIPPO?
06:08	IT WAS YOUR FATHER'S IDEA.
06:09	HE JUST DRAGGED ME ALONG.
06:11	WELL, THE HIPPO DID THE DRAGGING.
06:13	HEY, I RIDE ANIMALS, TOO!
06:15	ONE TIME, THERE WAS THIS GIANT EEL, AND I--
06:17	SO, WHO WAS IT THAT CAME UP
06:18	WITH THE GREAT BLUBBER FIASCO?
06:20	YOU KNEW ABOUT THAT?
06:21	EVERYONE DOES.
06:23	WHAT'S THAT STORY?
06:24	IT'S A LONG ONE, AANG.
06:25	SOME OTHER TIME.
06:27	YOU AND DAD HAD SO MANY HILARIOUS ADVENTURES.
06:29	NOT ALL OF WHICH WERE HILARIOUS AT THE TIME,
06:31	BUT EVERYTHING'S FUNNY WITH HINDSIGHT.
06:35	AANG!
06:36	PLEASE PUT THAT DOWN.
06:37	IT'S CEREMONIAL AND VERY FRAGILE.
06:40	Sokka: WAS IT YOU OR DAD
06:42	THAT PUT AN OCTOPUS ON YOUR HEAD
06:44	AND CONVINCED GRAN-GRAN YOU WERE A WATER SPIRIT?
06:45	YOUR DAD WORE THE OCTOPUS,
06:46	BUT I DID THE SPOOKY VOICE.
06:48	[PEOPLE CHEERING]
06:51	Man: AAH! UNH.
06:55	[GRUNTING]
07:02	OUT OF MY WAY! STEP ASIDE, FILTH.
07:05	HE MEANS NO OFFENSE.
07:06	I'M CERTAIN YOU BATHE REGULARLY.
07:09	I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
07:11	WELL, IF IT ISN'T MY NEW FRIENDS,
07:13	ANGRY BOY AND UNCLE LAZY.
07:15	HEH HEH HEH!
07:19	[CHEERING]
07:24	YOUR BEAST TRASHED MY SHIP.
07:25	YOU HAVE TO PAY ME BACK.
07:27	WELL, I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU OUT,
07:29	BUT I'M A LITTLE SHORT ON MONEY.
07:30	DRINKS ON ME!
07:32	[CHEERING AND SHOUTING]
07:37	MONEY ISN'T WHAT I HAD IN MIND.
07:41	I NEED YOU TO FIND SOMEONE.
07:42	WHAT HAPPENED?
07:44	YOUR GIRLFRIEND RUN OFF ON YOU?
07:45	IT'S NOT THE GIRL I'M AFTER.
07:47	IT'S THE BALD MONK SHE'S TRAVELING WITH.
07:49	WHATEVER YOU SAY.
07:50	IF YOU FIND THEM,
07:52	I'LL CONSIDER THE DAMAGE TO MY SHIP PAID FOR.
07:55	HA! FORGET IT.
07:57	PLUS WE'LL PAY YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD.
08:00	MAKE IT YOUR WEIGHT, AND WE GOT A DEAL.
08:03	HA HA HA! YOU GOT IT!
08:05	GET ON!
08:19	Bato: THERE'S SOMETHING I SHOULD TELL YOU KIDS.
08:21	I'M EXPECTING A MESSAGE FROM YOUR FATHER.
08:23	Katara: REALLY?
08:24	WHEN?
08:25	ANY DAY NOW.
08:27	YOUR FATHER SAID HE'D SEND A MESSAGE
08:29	WHEN THEY FOUND THE RENDEZVOUS POINT.
08:30	IF YOU WAIT HERE UNTIL THE MESSAGE ARRIVES,
08:33	YOU CAN COME WITH ME AND SEE YOUR FATHER AGAIN.
08:35	IT'S BEEN OVER TWO YEARS
08:37	SINCE WE'VE SEEN DAD.
08:38	THAT WOULD BE SO INCREDIBLE.
08:40	KATARA!
08:41	Katara: I DO REALLY MISS HIM.
08:43	IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE DAD.
08:45	Bato: IT'S BEEN FAR TOO LONG,
08:46	HASN'T IT?
08:48	I'M NOT SURE WHEN WORD WILL ARRIVE,
08:50	BUT WHEN IT DOES...
08:54	IT WOULD BE GREAT, BUT WE CAN'T.
08:56	WE HAVE TO TAKE AANG TO THE NORTH POLE FIRST.
08:59	EVEN IF WE HAD TIME TO WAIT FOR THE MESSAGE,
09:01	WHO KNOWS HOW FAR WE'D HAVE TO TRAVEL?
09:03	WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR A LONG DETOUR.
09:05	I'M SURE YOUR FATHER WOULD UNDERSTAND
09:08	AND BE PROUD THAT HIS CHILDREN ARE HELPING THE AVATAR.
09:14	I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD LEAVE ME.
09:17	[HORSE NEIGHING]
09:22	I'M LOOKING FOR BATO OF THE WATER TRIBE.
09:24	UH, I KNOW BATO.
09:26	MAKE SURE HE GETS THIS.
09:34	IT'S THE MAP TO SOKKA AND KATARA'S DAD.
09:52	HEY, EVERYONE.
09:53	SORRY I WAS GONE SO LONG.
09:55	HEY, AANG. I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU LEFT.
09:57	YEP. BUT NOW I'M BACK.
09:59	SURE COULD GO FOR SOME DELICIOUS SEA PRUNES.
10:02	MMM! YUM YUM! MMM!
10:05	[CHOKES]
10:06	MMM!
10:14	[ROAR]
10:17	OUT FOR A BIT OF FRESH AIR, ARE WE?
10:20	Zuko: WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.
10:21	I HOPE IT'S NOT MIYUKI.
10:24	MIYUKI, DID YOU GET IN TROUBLE
10:27	WITH THE FIRE NATION AGAIN?
10:28	[WHIMPER]
10:30	THE AVATAR'S BEEN THROUGH HERE.
10:31	LET'S KEEP MOVING.
10:45	AHA! I CAUGHT YOU.
10:47	YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.
10:49	LITTERING IN THE COURTYARD.
10:53	I'M SORRY. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.
11:00	Bato: THIS SHIP IS SENTIMENTAL TO ME.
11:03	IT WAS BUILT BY MY FATHER.
11:10	[WHISTLING]
11:11	Sokka: IS THIS THE BOAT HE TOOK YOU ICE DODGING IN?
11:13	Bato: YEP, AND IT'S GOT THE SCAR TO PROVE IT.
11:16	HA! HOW ABOUT YOU, SOKKA?
11:18	YOU MUST HAVE SOME GOOD STORIES
11:19	FROM YOUR FIRST TIME ICE DODGING.
11:21	HE NEVER GOT TO GO.
11:22	DAD LEFT BEFORE HE WAS OLD ENOUGH.
11:24	OH, I FORGOT. YOU WERE TOO YOUNG.
11:27	WHAT'S ICE DODGING?
11:29	IT'S A RITE OF PASSAGE FOR YOUNG WATER TRIBE MEMBERS.
11:31	WHEN YOU TURN 14, YOUR DAD TAKES YOU--
11:34	YOU KNOW WHAT?
11:36	YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.
11:43	[PEOPLE SCREAMING]
11:48	Zuko: WHY ARE WE STOPPING?
11:50	BECAUSE THE GIRL MUST HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME HERE.
11:52	WE HAVE NO TIME FOR THIS.
11:58	HEY, WATCH IT!
11:59	HEH HEH HEH!
12:00	OH, LOOK. HE LIKES YOU.
12:02	CARE TO HEAR YOUR FORTUNE, HANDSOME?
12:04	AT MY AGE, THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE BIG SURPRISE LEFT,
12:08	AND I'D JUST AS SOON LEAVE IT A MYSTERY.
12:11	[SNARLING]
12:17	Bato: ICE DODGING IS A CEREMONIAL TEST
12:19	OF WISDOM, BRAVERY, AND TRUST.
12:22	IN OUR VILLAGE, IT WAS DONE BY WEAVING A BOAT
12:24	THROUGH A FIELD OF ICEBERGS.
12:26	HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO ICE DODGE WITHOUT ICE?
12:28	YOU'LL BE DODGING... THOSE.
12:35	SOKKA, YOU STEER AND CALL THE SHOTS.
12:38	LEAD WISELY.
12:39	KATARA, YOU SECURE THE MAINSAIL.
12:42	THE WINDS CAN BE BRUTAL. SO BE BRAVE.
12:45	AANG, YOU CONTROL THE JIB.
12:47	WITHOUT YOUR STEADY HAND, WE ALL GO DOWN.
12:50	YOUR POSITION IS ABOUT TRUST.
12:53	I KNOW THAT! WHY WOULDN'T I KNOW THAT?
12:55	I'M THE AVATAR! I KNOW ABOUT TRUST.
12:58	FOR THIS TO BE DONE RIGHT, I CANNOT HELP.
13:01	YOU PASS OR FAIL ON YOUR OWN.
13:09	AANG, EASE UP ON THE JIB.
13:11	KATARA, STEADY.
13:16	AANG, LESS SAIL.
13:17	UNH! KATARA, GIVE HIM ROOM.
13:22	UNH!
13:27	AANG, HELM TO LEE. HELM TO LEE.
13:30	WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
13:32	[GRUNTS]
13:34	[GRUNTING]
13:42	GREAT JOB!
13:46	THERE'S NO WAY THROUGH!
13:48	WE CAN MAKE IT!
13:49	SOKKA, YOU'VE ALREADY PROVEN YOURSELF.
13:51	MAYBE WE SHOULD--
13:52	AANG! I'M GONNA NEED AIR IN THAT SAIL!
13:54	KATARA, I WANT YOU TO BEND AS MUCH WATER AS YOU CAN
13:56	BETWEEN US AND THOSE ROCKS.
13:59	NOW!
14:07	[GROANS]
14:15	[SIGH]
14:20	THE SPIRITS OF WATER BEAR WITNESS TO THESE MARKS.
14:24	FOR SOKKA, THE MARK OF THE WISE--
14:27	THE SAME MARK YOUR FATHER EARNED.
14:30	FOR KATARA, THE MARK OF THE BRAVE.
14:32	YOUR COURAGE INSPIRES US.
14:35	AND FOR AANG, THE MARK OF THE TRUSTED.
14:39	YOU ARE NOW AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE WATER TRIBE.
14:42	I CAN'T.
14:43	OF COURSE YOU CAN.
14:45	NO. YOU CAN'T TRUST ME.
14:47	AANG, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
14:51	A MESSENGER GAVE THIS TO ME FOR BATO.
14:55	YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T--
14:57	THIS IS THE MAP TO OUR FATHER!
14:59	YOU HAD IT THE WHOLE TIME?
15:01	HOW COULD YOU?
15:03	WELL, YOU CAN GO TO THE NORTH POLE ON YOUR OWN.
15:04	I'M GOING TO FIND DAD.
15:06	Bato: NOW, SOKKA, I THINK YOU SHOULD--
15:08	KATARA, ARE YOU WITH ME?
15:14	I'M WITH YOU, SOKKA.
15:35	GOOD LUCK.
15:36	OK. YOU, TOO.
15:45	GUESS I SHOULD BE MOVING ON.
15:46	THAT WOULD BE BEST.
15:55	I'M AN IDIOT, MOMO.
16:04	[FOOTSTEPS]
16:07	[ROARING]
16:17	WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.
16:25	[WOLF HOWLS]
16:28	THAT WOLF SOUNDS SO SAD.
16:30	IT'S PROBABLY WOUNDED.
16:31	NO. IT'S BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE PACK.
16:35	I UNDERSTAND THAT PAIN.
16:37	IT'S HOW I FELT WHEN THE WATER TRIBE WARRIORS
16:39	HAD TO LEAVE ME BEHIND.
16:41	THEY WERE MY FAMILY,
16:43	AND BEING APART FROM THEM WAS MORE PAINFUL THAN MY WOUNDS.
16:54	SOKKA?
16:56	WE NEED TO GO BACK.
16:57	I WANT TO SEE DAD,
16:59	BUT HELPING AANG IS WHERE WE'RE NEEDED THE MOST.
17:01	YOU'RE RIGHT.
17:02	YOUR FATHER WILL UNDERSTAND,
17:05	AND I KNOW HE'S PROUD OF YOU.
17:06	THANKS, BATO.
17:08	I KNOW WHERE TO GO FROM HERE.
17:09	TAKE THIS IN CASE YOU WANT TO FIND US.
17:12	I'LL LEAVE A MESSAGE AT THE RENDEZVOUS POINT.
17:16	LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING ALONE, GUYS.
17:18	AVATAR! YOU MUST LEAVE.
17:20	OK, I GET IT. EVERYBODY WANTS ME GONE.
17:23	A GROUP OF PEOPLE CAME TO THE ABBEY LOOKING FOR YOU.
17:26	WHO?
17:28	A FIERCE-LOOKING WOMAN WITH A HORRIBLE MONSTER
17:29	AND A YOUNG MAN WITH A SCAR.
17:31	ZUKO.
17:33	THE BEAST WAS USING THE SCENT OF THE NECKLACE
17:34	TO FOLLOW YOU.
17:35	A NECKLACE?
17:36	[GASP]
17:37	KATARA!
17:44	[FOOTSTEPS]
17:47	[ROARING]
17:51	SO THIS IS YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
17:53	NO WONDER SHE LEFT.
17:55	SHE'S WAY TOO PRETTY FOR YOU.
17:56	WHERE IS HE? WHERE'S THE AVATAR?
17:59	WE SPLIT UP. HE'S LONG GONE.
18:01	HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK I AM?
18:03	PRETTY STUPID. RUN!
18:07	Both: AAH! UNH!
18:09	Zuko: WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?
18:13	IT'S SEEKING A DIFFERENT SCENT,
18:14	PERHAPS SOMETHING THAT THE AVATAR HELD.
18:17	[SNIFFING]
18:24	[SCREAMING]
18:32	Zuko: WHAT'S IT DOING?
18:33	IT'S JUST GOING IN A CIRCLE.
18:43	[YELLING]
18:48	AANG!
18:48	UP!
19:09	HAH!
19:13	AARGH!
19:20	AAH!
19:20	UNH!
19:23	OOF!
19:25	UNH!
19:34	COME ON, GET UP!
19:53	[GROWLING]
20:04	UNH!
20:08	[GRUNTS]
20:09	[GASP]
20:12	AAH!
20:32	I'M STARTING TO GET SOME FEELING BACK.
20:35	OW.
20:46	[SNIFFS]
20:47	AHH.
20:59	YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING I WANT.
21:22	AAH!
21:23	UNH!
21:31	OOF!
21:56	[SNIFF]
21:57	UGH.
21:58	[SNIFF]
21:59	THAT THING SEES WITH ITS NOSE.
22:01	LET'S GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO LOOK AT.
22:02	THE PERFUME?
22:32	OHH!
22:35	JUNE, NO!
22:47	UNCLE?
22:49	I DIDN'T SEE YOU GET HIT WITH THE TONGUE.
22:51	SHH.
22:57	SO... WHERE DO WE GO?
22:59	WE'RE GETTING YOU TO THE NORTH POLE.
23:01	YEAH. WE'VE LOST TOO MUCH TIME AS IT IS.
23:04	DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR FATHER?
23:06	OF COURSE WE DO, AANG,
23:07	BUT YOU'RE OUR FAMILY, TOO,
23:09	AND RIGHT NOW, YOU NEED US MORE.
23:11	AND WE NEED YOU.
23:13	I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU A LITTLE PIECE OF HOME, KATARA,
23:16	SOMETHING TO REMIND YOU--
23:17	I'LL BE OK.
23:19	STILL, JUST A LITTLE TRINKET.
23:21	MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE...THIS?
23:25	AANG! HOW'D YOU GET THAT?
23:28	ZUKO ASKED ME TO BE SURE I GOT IT TO YOU.
23:31	OH, THAT'S SO SWEET OF ZUKO.
23:34	WOULD YOU GIVE HIM A KISS FOR ME WHEN YOU SEE HIM?
23:35	SURE.
23:37	MWAH.
