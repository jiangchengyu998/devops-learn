00:09	katara: water...
00:11	earth...
00:13	fire...
00:15	air.
00:17	long ago, the 4 nations lived together in harmony.
00:21	then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
00:26	only the avatar, master of all 4 elements,
00:28	could stop them.
00:30	but when the world needed him most,
00:31	he vanished.
00:33	a hundred years passed,
00:35	and my brother and i discovered the new avatar,
00:37	an airbender named aang,
00:39	and although his airbending skills are great,
00:41	he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
00:45	but i believe aang can save the world.
00:57	100 years have passed,
00:58	and the fire nation is nearing victory in the war.
01:02	two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe
01:04	journeyed to the earth kingdom
01:06	to help fight against the fire nation,
01:08	leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.
01:11	try to understand,
01:13	i need to capture him to restore something i've lost--
01:15	my honor.
01:17	perhaps in exchange,
01:18	i can restore something you've lost.
01:21	my mother's necklace.
01:39	hey, look! a sword made out of a whale's tooth!
01:41	let me see that.
01:53	this is a water tribe weapon.
01:55	see if you can find anything else.
01:58	did someone lose something?
01:59	no, we found something.
02:04	it's burned.
02:06	there was a battle.
02:08	water tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders.
02:11	the firebenders fought back,
02:13	but the warriors drove them down this hill.
02:21	so then what happened?
02:23	i don't know. the trail ends here.
02:25	wait! look!
02:27	it's one of our boats!
02:30	katara: is this dad's boat?
02:32	no, but it's from his fleet.
02:35	dad was here.
02:39	ahh!
02:41	see, prince zuko?
02:43	a moment of quiet is good for your mental well-being.
02:48	unh!
02:50	[grunts]
02:51	watch out!
02:52	[growling]
02:53	get back!
02:55	we're after a stowaway.
02:56	there are no stowaways on my ship.
03:07	[man breathing heavily]
03:13	he's paralyzed.
03:15	only temporarily.
03:16	the toxins will wear off in about an hour,
03:18	but by then, he'll be in jail
03:19	and i'll have my money.
03:21	but how did you find him on my ship?
03:23	my xierxu can smell a rat a continent away.
03:26	well, i'm impressed.
03:32	very impressed.
03:54	sokka.
03:55	i'm coming with you.
03:57	you're not old enough to go to war, sokka.
03:58	you know that.
03:59	i'm strong. i'm brave.
04:01	i can fight!
04:03	please, dad?
04:05	being a man is knowing where you're needed the most,
04:08	and for you right now, that's here protecting your sister.
04:11	i don't understand.
04:13	someday you will.
04:16	i'm gonna miss you so much.
04:18	[sobbing]
04:24	who's there?
04:27	sokka?
04:28	bato?
04:29	who the what now?
04:30	bato!
04:32	sakko! katara!
04:34	it is so good to see you two.
04:37	oh. you've grown so much.
04:39	hi. i'm aang.
04:41	where's dad?
04:41	is he here?
04:42	no. he and the other warriors
04:44	should be in the eastern earth kingdom by now.
04:47	[wind blowing]
04:49	[shudder]
04:50	this is no place for a reunion.
04:51	let's get inside.
04:58	after i was wounded,
05:00	your father carried me to this abbey.
05:03	the sisters have cared for me ever since.
05:06	superior, these are kota's children.
05:08	they've been traveling with the avatar.
05:10	i found them by my boat.
05:12	young avatar, it gives me great joy
05:14	to be in your presence.
05:16	welcome to our abbey.
05:18	thank you. it's truly an honor to be here.
05:21	if there's anything--
05:22	what smells so good, bato?
05:23	[sniffs]
05:25	the sisters craft ointments and perfumes.
05:27	perfume?
05:29	maybe we could dump some on appa,
05:30	because he stinks so much.
05:32	am i right?
05:34	[person coughs]
05:36	you have your father's wit.
05:39	bato, it looks like home!
05:41	everything's here, even the pelts.
05:44	yeah. nothing's cozier than dead animal skins.
05:50	ack!
05:54	no way! stewed sea prunes?
05:57	help yourself.
05:59	dad could eat a whole barrel of these things.
06:02	[sniffs]
06:03	ugh!
06:05	bato, is it true you and dad lassoed an arctic hippo?
06:08	it was your father's idea.
06:09	he just dragged me along.
06:11	well, the hippo did the dragging.
06:13	hey, i ride animals, too!
06:15	one time, there was this giant eel, and i--
06:17	so, who was it that came up
06:18	with the great blubber fiasco?
06:20	you knew about that?
06:21	everyone does.
06:23	what's that story?
06:24	it's a long one, aang.
06:25	some other time.
06:27	you and dad had so many hilarious adventures.
06:29	not all of which were hilarious at the time,
06:31	but everything's funny with hindsight.
06:35	aang!
06:36	please put that down.
06:37	it's ceremonial and very fragile.
06:40	sokka: was it you or dad
06:42	that put an octopus on your head
06:44	and convinced gran-gran you were a water spirit?
06:45	your dad wore the octopus,
06:46	but i did the spooky voice.
06:48	[people cheering]
06:51	man: aah! unh.
06:55	[grunting]
07:02	out of my way! step aside, filth.
07:05	he means no offense.
07:06	i'm certain you bathe regularly.
07:09	i need to talk to you.
07:11	well, if it isn't my new friends,
07:13	angry boy and uncle lazy.
07:15	heh heh heh!
07:19	[cheering]
07:24	your beast trashed my ship.
07:25	you have to pay me back.
07:27	well, i'd love to help you out,
07:29	but i'm a little short on money.
07:30	drinks on me!
07:32	[cheering and shouting]
07:37	money isn't what i had in mind.
07:41	i need you to find someone.
07:42	what happened?
07:44	your girlfriend run off on you?
07:45	it's not the girl i'm after.
07:47	it's the bald monk she's traveling with.
07:49	whatever you say.
07:50	if you find them,
07:52	i'll consider the damage to my ship paid for.
07:55	ha! forget it.
07:57	plus we'll pay your weight in gold.
08:00	make it your weight, and we got a deal.
08:03	ha ha ha! you got it!
08:05	get on!
08:19	bato: there's something i should tell you kids.
08:21	i'm expecting a message from your father.
08:23	katara: really?
08:24	when?
08:25	any day now.
08:27	your father said he'd send a message
08:29	when they found the rendezvous point.
08:30	if you wait here until the message arrives,
08:33	you can come with me and see your father again.
08:35	it's been over two years
08:37	since we've seen dad.
08:38	that would be so incredible.
08:40	katara!
08:41	katara: i do really miss him.
08:43	it would be great to see dad.
08:45	bato: it's been far too long,
08:46	hasn't it?
08:48	i'm not sure when word will arrive,
08:50	but when it does...
08:54	it would be great, but we can't.
08:56	we have to take aang to the north pole first.
08:59	even if we had time to wait for the message,
09:01	who knows how far we'd have to travel?
09:03	we don't have time for a long detour.
09:05	i'm sure your father would understand
09:08	and be proud that his children are helping the avatar.
09:14	i can't believe they would leave me.
09:17	[horse neighing]
09:22	i'm looking for bato of the water tribe.
09:24	uh, i know bato.
09:26	make sure he gets this.
09:34	it's the map to sokka and katara's dad.
09:52	hey, everyone.
09:53	sorry i was gone so long.
09:55	hey, aang. i didn't notice you left.
09:57	yep. but now i'm back.
09:59	sure could go for some delicious sea prunes.
10:02	mmm! yum yum! mmm!
10:05	[chokes]
10:06	mmm!
10:14	[roar]
10:17	out for a bit of fresh air, are we?
10:20	zuko: we're looking for someone.
10:21	i hope it's not miyuki.
10:24	miyuki, did you get in trouble
10:27	with the fire nation again?
10:28	[whimper]
10:30	the avatar's been through here.
10:31	let's keep moving.
10:45	aha! i caught you.
10:47	you should be ashamed of yourself.
10:49	littering in the courtyard.
10:53	i'm sorry. i'll take care of this.
11:00	bato: this ship is sentimental to me.
11:03	it was built by my father.
11:10	[whistling]
11:11	sokka: is this the boat he took you ice dodging in?
11:13	bato: yep, and it's got the scar to prove it.
11:16	ha! how about you, sokka?
11:18	you must have some good stories
11:19	from your first time ice dodging.
11:21	he never got to go.
11:22	dad left before he was old enough.
11:24	oh, i forgot. you were too young.
11:27	what's ice dodging?
11:29	it's a rite of passage for young water tribe members.
11:31	when you turn 14, your dad takes you--
11:34	you know what?
11:36	you're about to find out.
11:43	[people screaming]
11:48	zuko: why are we stopping?
11:50	because the girl must have spent a lot of time here.
11:52	we have no time for this.
11:58	hey, watch it!
11:59	heh heh heh!
12:00	oh, look. he likes you.
12:02	care to hear your fortune, handsome?
12:04	at my age, there's really only one big surprise left,
12:08	and i'd just as soon leave it a mystery.
12:11	[snarling]
12:17	bato: ice dodging is a ceremonial test
12:19	of wisdom, bravery, and trust.
12:22	in our village, it was done by weaving a boat
12:24	through a field of icebergs.
12:26	how are we supposed to ice dodge without ice?
12:28	you'll be dodging... those.
12:35	sokka, you steer and call the shots.
12:38	lead wisely.
12:39	katara, you secure the mainsail.
12:42	the winds can be brutal. so be brave.
12:45	aang, you control the jib.
12:47	without your steady hand, we all go down.
12:50	your position is about trust.
12:53	i know that! why wouldn't i know that?
12:55	i'm the avatar! i know about trust.
12:58	for this to be done right, i cannot help.
13:01	you pass or fail on your own.
13:09	aang, ease up on the jib.
13:11	katara, steady.
13:16	aang, less sail.
13:17	unh! katara, give him room.
13:22	unh!
13:27	aang, helm to lee. helm to lee.
13:30	what does that even mean?
13:32	[grunts]
13:34	[grunting]
13:42	great job!
13:46	there's no way through!
13:48	we can make it!
13:49	sokka, you've already proven yourself.
13:51	maybe we should--
13:52	aang! i'm gonna need air in that sail!
13:54	katara, i want you to bend as much water as you can
13:56	between us and those rocks.
13:59	now!
14:07	[groans]
14:15	[sigh]
14:20	the spirits of water bear witness to these marks.
14:24	for sokka, the mark of the wise--
14:27	the same mark your father earned.
14:30	for katara, the mark of the brave.
14:32	your courage inspires us.
14:35	and for aang, the mark of the trusted.
14:39	you are now an honorary member of the water tribe.
14:42	i can't.
14:43	of course you can.
14:45	no. you can't trust me.
14:47	aang, what are you talking about?
14:51	a messenger gave this to me for bato.
14:55	you have to understand. i was afraid you wouldn't--
14:57	this is the map to our father!
14:59	you had it the whole time?
15:01	how could you?
15:03	well, you can go to the north pole on your own.
15:04	i'm going to find dad.
15:06	bato: now, sokka, i think you should--
15:08	katara, are you with me?
15:14	i'm with you, sokka.
15:35	good luck.
15:36	ok. you, too.
15:45	guess i should be moving on.
15:46	that would be best.
15:55	i'm an idiot, momo.
16:04	[footsteps]
16:07	[roaring]
16:17	we're getting close.
16:25	[wolf howls]
16:28	that wolf sounds so sad.
16:30	it's probably wounded.
16:31	no. it's been separated from the pack.
16:35	i understand that pain.
16:37	it's how i felt when the water tribe warriors
16:39	had to leave me behind.
16:41	they were my family,
16:43	and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds.
16:54	sokka?
16:56	we need to go back.
16:57	i want to see dad,
16:59	but helping aang is where we're needed the most.
17:01	you're right.
17:02	your father will understand,
17:05	and i know he's proud of you.
17:06	thanks, bato.
17:08	i know where to go from here.
17:09	take this in case you want to find us.
17:12	i'll leave a message at the rendezvous point.
17:16	looks like we're going alone, guys.
17:18	avatar! you must leave.
17:20	ok, i get it. everybody wants me gone.
17:23	a group of people came to the abbey looking for you.
17:26	who?
17:28	a fierce-looking woman with a horrible monster
17:29	and a young man with a scar.
17:31	zuko.
17:33	the beast was using the scent of the necklace
17:34	to follow you.
17:35	a necklace?
17:36	[gasp]
17:37	katara!
17:44	[footsteps]
17:47	[roaring]
17:51	so this is your girlfriend.
17:53	no wonder she left.
17:55	she's way too pretty for you.
17:56	where is he? where's the avatar?
17:59	we split up. he's long gone.
18:01	how stupid do you think i am?
18:03	pretty stupid. run!
18:07	both: aah! unh!
18:09	zuko: what are we supposed to do now?
18:13	it's seeking a different scent,
18:14	perhaps something that the avatar held.
18:17	[sniffing]
18:24	[screaming]
18:32	zuko: what's it doing?
18:33	it's just going in a circle.
18:43	[yelling]
18:48	aang!
18:48	up!
19:09	hah!
19:13	aargh!
19:20	aah!
19:20	unh!
19:23	oof!
19:25	unh!
19:34	come on, get up!
19:53	[growling]
20:04	unh!
20:08	[grunts]
20:09	[gasp]
20:12	aah!
20:32	i'm starting to get some feeling back.
20:35	ow.
20:46	[sniffs]
20:47	ahh.
20:59	you've got something i want.
21:22	aah!
21:23	unh!
21:31	oof!
21:56	[sniff]
21:57	ugh.
21:58	[sniff]
21:59	that thing sees with its nose.
22:01	let's give him something to look at.
22:02	the perfume?
22:32	ohh!
22:35	june, no!
22:47	uncle?
22:49	i didn't see you get hit with the tongue.
22:51	shh.
22:57	so... where do we go?
22:59	we're getting you to the north pole.
23:01	yeah. we've lost too much time as it is.
23:04	don't you want to see your father?
23:06	of course we do, aang,
23:07	but you're our family, too,
23:09	and right now, you need us more.
23:11	and we need you.
23:13	i wish i could give you a little piece of home, katara,
23:16	something to remind you--
23:17	i'll be ok.
23:19	still, just a little trinket.
23:21	maybe something like...this?
23:25	aang! how'd you get that?
23:28	zuko asked me to be sure i got it to you.
23:31	oh, that's so sweet of zuko.
23:34	would you give him a kiss for me when you see him?
23:35	sure.
23:37	mwah.
