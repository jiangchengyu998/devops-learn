00:09	water.

00:10	earth.

00:12	fire.

00:14	air.

00:16	long ago, the 4 nations lived together in harmony.

00:21	then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.

00:25	only the avatar, master of all 4 elements,

00:28	could stop them.

00:29	but when the world needed him most,

00:31	he vanished.

00:33	100 years passed, and my brother and i

00:35	discovered the new avatar, an airbender named aang.

00:39	and although his airbending skills are great,

00:40	he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

00:43	aang: unh!

00:44	but i believe aang can save the world.

01:32	[grunting]

01:37	um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?

01:39	right. got it.

01:41	sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top of the tent.

01:45	you know, so we don't get rained on?

01:47	ordinarily you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season,

01:50	you're not.

01:51	besides, that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.

01:53	but what if it does rain?

01:54	what if it doesn't?

01:56	then i would have put the tarp up for nothing.

01:58	uh! you're infuriating.
 
02:00	katara, why don't you worry about gathering the firewood?
because that kindling's looking pretty sorry.

02:06	if you don't like my firewood--

02:08	uh!

02:09	fine by me! if you're not gonna do your job--

02:12	uh!

02:13	ok, i got the grub if you guys got the--

02:16	hey, where's the campfire,

02:17	and what happened to the tent?

02:19	why don't you ask miss know it all, queen of the twigs?

02:22	oh, yeah? well, you're mr. lazy bum, king of the...tents!

02:27	[chuckling]

02:28	ok. listen, guys.

02:30	harsh words won't solve problems.

02:32	action will.

02:34	why don't you just switch jobs?

02:36	sounds good.

02:36	whatever.

02:37	you see that?

02:38	settling feuds and making peace--all in a day's work for the avatar.

02:42	[yowling]

02:58	come on, momo. that's fair.

03:00	appa's got 5 stomachs.

03:05	[chattering]

03:07	there it is, guys-- the great divide.

03:10	wow. i could just stare at it forever.

03:13	ok. i've seen enough.

03:14	how can you not be fascinated, sokka?

03:17	this is the largest canyon in the entire world.

03:20	then i'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly

03:22	from the air while we fly away.

03:24	hey, if you're looking for the canyon guide,

03:25	i was here first.

03:27	ooh. canyon guide. sounds informative.

03:30	believe me, he's more than a tour guide.

03:32	he's an earthbender, and the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help.

03:37	and he's taking my tribe across next.

03:39	calm down. we know you're next.

03:41	you wouldn't be calm if the fire nation destroyed your home and forced you to flee.

03:45	my whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of fa sing sei.

03:50	you're a refugee.

03:52	huh. tell me something i don't know.

03:56	is that your tribe?

03:57	it most certainly is not.

03:59	that's the zhang tribe,

04:01	a bunch of lowlife thieves.

04:02	they've been the enemies of my tribe for a hundred years.

04:05	[whistles]

04:06	hey, zhangs!

04:08	i'm saving a spot for my tribe, so don't even think of stealing it.

04:12	where are the rest of the gan jin?

04:14	still tidying up their campsite?

04:16	yes, but they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot.

04:20	i didn't know the canyon guide took reservations.

04:22	huh! of course he didn't.

04:24	that's the ignorance i'd expect from a messy zhang, so unorganized and ill-prepared for a journey.

04:29	[men shouting]

04:34	[chattering]

04:36	uhh!

04:40	sorry about the wait, youngsters.

04:43	who's ready to cross this here canyon?

04:46	uh, one of them, i think.

04:48	i was here first. my party's on their way.

04:51	i can't guide people who aren't here.

04:54	guess you guys will have to make the trip tomorrow.

04:58	wait! here they come.

05:06	you're not seriously gonna cave in to these spoiled gan jins.

05:09	i mean, we're refugees, too,

05:11	and we've got sick people that need shelter.

05:14	i, uh, well...

05:16	we've got old people who are weary from traveling.

05:18	sick people get priority over old people.

05:21	maybe you zhangs wouldn't have so many sick people

05:24	if you weren't such slobs.

05:26	if you gan jins weren't so clean, maybe you wouldn't live to be so old.

05:31	gan jin: i could smell your stink...

05:32	well, aang, ready to put

05:34	your peacemaking skills to the test?

05:35	i-i don't know.

05:36	a fight over chores is one thing.

05:38	these people have been feuding for a hundred years.

05:41	everyone listen up!

05:43	this is the avatar,

05:45	and if you give him a chance,

05:46	i'm sure he can come up with a compromise

05:48	that will make everyone happy.

05:52	uh, you could share the earthbender and travel together?

05:56	absolutely not. we'd rather be taken by the fire nation

05:59	than travel with those stinking thieves.

06:02	we wouldn't travel with you pompous fools anyway.

06:04	[all arguing]

06:06	all right, here's the deal!

06:07	you're all going down together,

06:09	and appa here will fly your sick and elderly across.

06:12	does that seem fair?

06:24	sorry, appa. you'll have to do this on your own.

06:27	aang, this feuding tribe stuff is serious business.

06:30	are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?

06:32	to tell the truth, i'm not sure,

06:35	but when have i ever been?

06:36	he's the avatar, sokka.

06:38	making peace between people is his job.

06:40	his job's gonna make us cross this whole thing on foot, isn't it?

06:44	ok, now comes the bad news.

06:46	no food allowed in the canyon.

06:49	it attracts dangerous predators.

06:53	no food? this is ridiculous.

06:56	oh, you babies can go a day without food.

07:00	would you rather be hungry or dead?

07:04	now, we're heading down in 10 minutes.

07:06	all food better be in your gut

07:09	or in the garbage!

07:16	appa's gonna take good care of you till we get there.

07:20	see you on the other side, buddy.

07:22	yip yip!

07:23	[grunt]

07:36	huh!

07:38	aang: nice bending.

07:40	the job's much more than bending, kid.

07:43	folks want information.

07:46	many of you are probably wondering

07:48	how canyons are formed.

07:51	experts tell us this canyon was most likely

07:53	carved into the ground by earth spirits,

07:56	who were angry at local farmers

07:59	for not offering them a proper sacrifice.

08:04	[gasp]

08:04	[gasp]

08:05	[rumbling]

08:08	[screaming]

08:09	uh! ha ha! guess the spirits are still angry.

08:14	hope you all brought sacrifices.

08:21	guide: ok. everyone stand clear of the wall.

08:25	uh! uh!

08:30	why did you do that?

08:31	these people are fleeing

08:33	the fire nation, aren't they?

08:35	i've got to make sure we can't be followed.

08:37	we'll be safe now.

08:39	uh!

08:41	ah!

08:44	we've got to help him! uh!

08:47	aah!

08:49	[cough]

08:51	ok, now we've got to help me!

08:58	aah!

08:59	hah!

09:14	what was that?

09:15	canyon crawler.

09:17	oh. and there's sure to be more.

09:20	your arms-- they're broken.

09:23	without my arms, i got no bending.

09:25	in other words...

09:27	we're trapped in this canyon.

09:39	i thought the whole point of ditching our food

09:41	was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like canyon crawlers.

09:44	it's the zhangs.

09:45	they took food down here even after the guide told them not to.

09:49	what?

09:51	if there's anyone who can't go without food for a day,

09:53	it's these pampered gan jins.

09:55	gan jin: i hope you're happy.

09:56	we're stuck in this canyon with no way out.

09:59	why don't you thank yourself, food-hider?

10:01	look, sticking together is the only way to--

10:04	i'm not walking another step with the likes of them.

10:07	now there's something we can agree on.

10:10	any ideas?

10:11	no bending. we need to get out of this canyon.

10:13	i won't die down here.

10:16	i won't become part of the food chain.

10:19	see? we're going to become part of the food chain

10:22	because of you.

10:23	sure. unjustly blame the zhangs, like you always do.

10:26	gladly.

10:28	aang: enough!

10:29	i thought i could help you guys get along,

10:31	but i guess that's not gonna happen.

10:35	we should split up--

10:36	gan jins on this side and zhangs on that side.

10:39	we'll travel in two separate lines.

10:48	sokka, you go with the zhangs,

10:50	and, katara, you go with the gan jins.

10:52	see if you can find out

10:53	why they hate each other so much.

11:14	so you guys aren't gonna put up your tarps?

11:16	what for? it's the dry season.

11:18	exactly!

11:20	besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket.

11:23	finally someone gets it.

11:32	do you really think it'll rain?

11:34	no, but you can never be too careful, right?

11:52	[gasp]

11:56	would you care for some bread, katara?

11:58	so it was you guys who had food.

12:00	oh, come now.

12:01	do you really think that tribe of thieves

12:02	isn't smuggling food?

12:04	why should my people go hungry

12:06	when the sneaky zhangs are stuffing their faces?

12:09	well, i guess it's ok if everyone's doing it.

12:17	so why does your tribe hate the zhangs so much?

12:21	you seem like a smart girl, katara.

12:23	i bet you would enjoy hearing some history.

12:33	gan jin: the patriarch of our tribe, ghin wai,

12:36	was an earthbender warrior

12:37	who was assigned an important duty:

12:40	transporting our sacred orb

12:42	from the great eastern gate to the great western gate.

12:51	taking the orb from the east to the west

12:53	represents the sun's rising and setting.

12:56	it was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual.

13:01	but as he approached the gate,

13:02	ghin wai was attacked by one of the zhangs--

13:06	a vermin named wai ghin

13:08	who looked at the orb with envy.

13:11	that coward wai ghin knocked ghin wai to the ground

13:15	and stole our sacred orb.

13:19	our people have never forgotten.

13:21	you can never trust a zhang.

13:30	care for some meat?

13:31	would i?

13:33	i know what you must be thinking.

13:35	we're horrible for endangering everybody

13:37	by bringing food down here.

13:38	mm-hmm.

13:40	the gan jins think so badly of us,

13:41	they probably assumed we brought food in

13:44	and decided to bring food in themselves.

13:46	that's why we brought food in.

13:47	mmm.

13:48	our conflict with the gan jin

13:50	goes back over 100 years.

13:57	zhang: our forefather, wai ghin, was leaving the western gate

13:59	of our village when he saw a figure in the distance.

14:03	it was a man of the gan jin tribe--ghin wai--

14:07	collapsed on the ground.

14:09	noble wai ghin stopped to help him.

14:11	ghin wai was transporting a sacred orb,

14:14	a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual.

14:18	wai ghin tried to tend to the man's wounds,

14:20	but ghin wai insisted the orb was more important

14:24	and asked him to take it back to his tribe.

14:26	kind wai ghin promised to send help for the man

14:30	as soon as he could.

14:31	but as wai ghin crossed the border

14:33	to return the orb into gan jin territory,

14:35	he was arrested.

14:37	[swords clang]

14:41	instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed,

14:44	they sentenced him to 20 long years in prison.

14:49	we zhangs will never forget that injustice.

14:53	that's just terrible.

14:55	are you gonna finish that?

14:56	[grunting]

14:58	aang: sure would be nice

14:59	to be around one of those campfires

15:01	telling stories and laughing.

15:04	it's ok, momo. we'll be out of here soon enough,

15:07	and then we can eat our weight in litchi nuts.

15:10	[squeak]

15:11	[buzzing]

15:15	[squeaks]

15:16	nah. i'll wait for the litchi nuts.

15:19	guide: it's lonely, isn't it, being impartial?

15:23	i wish i could help these people get along,

15:25	but it just seems impossible.

15:27	anyhow, i guess our biggest problem

15:29	is getting out of here.

15:30	i'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated.

15:42	all clear. we're almost to the other side.

15:55	aang: katara, sokko, will these people cooperate long enough

15:58	to get out of the canyon?

16:00	i don't think so, aang.

16:01	the zhangs really wronged the gan jins.

16:03	they ambushed ghin wai and stole the sacred orb.

16:06	what are you talking about?

16:08	yeah, katara, what are you talking about?

16:10	wai ghin didn't steal the orb.

16:12	he was returning it to their village gate

16:14	and was wrongfully punished by the gan jin.

16:16	not punished enough, if you ask me.

16:18	ok, ok. i get it. now i need your help.

16:21	let's get everyone together

16:22	at the base of the canyon wall.

16:26	[crowd cheering]

16:32	please, everyone. as soon as we get out of here,

16:34	we can eat and then go our separate ways.

16:36	but i need you all to put your heads together

16:38	and figure out a way up this cliff.

16:40	maybe the zhang can climb the wall

16:42	with their long, disgusting fingernails.

16:44	zhang: oh, sorry. i forgot that to the gan jin,

16:47	unclipped fingernails is a crime

16:50	punishable by 20 years in jail.

16:51	why, you dirty thief.

16:53	you pompous fool.

16:55	[all shouting at once]

16:57	guys, focus!

16:59	how many times do i have to say it?

17:00	harsh words won't solve problems.

17:02	action will!

17:05	perhaps the avatar is right.

17:07	yes. perhaps he is.

17:11	harsh words will never solve our problems.

17:14	action will.

17:18	huh!

17:18	huh!

17:19	aah!

17:24	to the death, and let this be the end of this rivalry.

17:28	aang: you know, i take it back.

17:30	harsh words aren't so bad.

17:40	huh?

17:43	[grunts]

17:48	hyah!

17:57	aang: is that food?

18:00	everyone smuggled food down here?

18:02	unbelievable!

18:03	you guys put our lives in danger

18:05	because you couldn't go without a snack for a day?

18:07	you are all awful!

18:17	so hungry.

18:19	is that egg custard in that tart?

18:27	[screeching]

18:28	[shouting]

18:31	oh, no. that's a lot of canyon crawlers.

18:35	we barely survived one.

18:37	guide: they're coming back for me.

18:39	they've had a taste, and they're coming back for me.

18:42	sokka, wait.

18:43	i don't care about the stupid feud.

18:45	i just want us to get out of here alive.

18:48	me, too. i only took their side because they fed me.

18:51	[snorting]

18:56	hyah!

19:10	hyah!

19:17	[gasp]

19:19	[shouting]

19:24	aah!

19:25	[screaming]

19:30	aah!

19:31	[panting]

19:52	everybody, watch me and do what i do!

20:22	now follow me.

20:24	we're riding out of this hole.

20:43	everyone get off!

20:49	we made it!

20:51	uh!

20:54	huh!

21:03	i never thought a gan jin

21:05	could get his hands dirty like that.

21:06	and i never knew you zhangs

21:08	were so reliable in a pinch.

21:10	perhaps we're not so different after all.

21:12	[sigh]

21:14	too bad we can't rewrite history.

21:16	you thieves stole our sacred orb from ghin wai.

21:20	you tyrants unjustly imprisoned wai ghin for 20 long years.

21:25	ugh. wait a second.

21:28	ghin wai? wai ghin? i know those guys.

21:32	yes, yes. we're all aware of the story.

21:35	no, i mean i really knew them.

21:37	i might not look it, but i'm 112 years old.

21:40	i was there 100 years ago

21:42	on the day you're talking about.

21:44	there seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened.

21:47	first of all, ghin wai and wai ghin weren't enemies.

21:50	they were brothers-- twins, in fact.

21:53	and they were 8, and most importantly,

21:56	they were just playing a game.

21:58	ahh!

21:58	ahh!

21:59	the sacred orb from the legend--

22:00	that was the ball.

22:02	and the eastern and western gates

22:03	were the goal posts.

22:05	ghin wai had the ball and was running toward the goal

22:07	when he fell and fumbled it.

22:09	wai ghin didn't steal the ball.

22:11	he picked it up and started running it back

22:13	toward the other goal, but he stepped out of bounds.

22:15	[blows whistle]

22:17	so the official put him in the penalty box--

22:19	not for 20 long years but for 2 short minutes.

22:22	hee hee hee!

22:23	there was no stealing and no putting anyone in prison--

22:26	just a game.

22:28	you're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball?

22:31	nope, just a regular ball.

22:33	what about our tribe's redemption ritual?

22:35	that's what the game was called--redemption.

22:38	as soon as someone got the ball from one goal to the other,

22:41	everyone would yell "redemption!"

22:45	don't get me wrong-- wai ghin was kind of a slob,

22:47	and ghin wai was a little stuffy.

22:48	that much is true.

22:50	but they respected each other's differences

22:52	enough to share the same playing field.

22:55	i suppose it's time we forget the past.

22:58	and look to the future.

23:09	good to see you, boy. did you miss me? ha ha ha!

23:12	i cannot thank you enough, avatar.

23:15	well, you know. i try.

23:16	oh!

23:19	let us travel to the earth kingdom capital

23:22	as one tribe.

23:24	[cheering]

23:25	i'm going, too!

23:27	i'm sick of this place.

23:29	that's some luck you knew ghin wai and wai ghin.

23:32	you could call it luck,

23:34	or you could call it lying.

23:35	what?

23:36	i made the whole thing up.

23:38	you did not.

23:40	that is so wrong.

23:42	now, where's that custard tart?

23:44	i'm starving!
