00:10	Katara: WATER.
00:11	EARTH.
00:13	FIRE.
00:15	AIR.
00:17	LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.
00:22	THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.
00:26	ONLY THE AVATAR, MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,
00:29	COULD STOP THEM.
00:30	BUT WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED HIM MOST, HE VANISHED.
00:33	100 YEARS PASSED,
00:35	AND MY BROTHER AND I DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR,
00:37	AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG.
00:39	AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING SKILLS ARE GREAT,
00:41	HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN BEFORE HE'S READY TO SAVE ANYONE.
00:45	BUT I BELIEVE AANG CAN SAVE THE WORLD.
00:58	THIS WHOLE AVATAR THING.
01:00	MAYBE THE MONKS MADE A MISTAKE.
01:02	WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US YOU WERE THE AVATAR?
01:05	BECAUSE...
01:07	I NEVER WANTED TO BE.
01:09	YOU'RE JUST A BANISHED PRINCE.
01:11	YOUR OWN FATHER DOESN'T EVEN WANT YOU.
01:13	THAT'S NOT TRUE.
01:15	YOU HAVE THE SCAR TO PROVE IT.
01:17	HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN WHAT HAPPENED
01:19	LAST TIME YOU DUELED THE MASTER?
01:21	I WILL NEVER FORGET.
01:51	Katara: WE NEED YOU, AANG.
01:53	I NEED YOU, TOO.
02:00	BE CAREFUL, GUYS!
02:03	GUYS?
02:05	GYATSO?
02:07	Gyatso: WHY DID YOU DISAPPEAR?
02:09	I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
02:16	WE NEED YOU, AANG.
02:19	[AANG SCREAMS]
02:24	Voices: WE NEED YOU, AANG. WE NEED YOU.
02:27	WE NEED YOU, AANG. WE NEED YOU.
02:30	[MOMO CHITTERS]
02:32	HUH! WHAT'S GOING ON?
02:33	DID WE GET CAPTURED AGAIN?
02:35	IT'S NOTHING. I JUST HAD A BAD DREAM.
02:37	GO BACK TO SLEEP.
02:39	YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME TWICE.
02:40	ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, AANG?
02:42	I'M OK.
02:44	YOU SEEM TO BE HAVING A LOT OF NIGHTMARES LATELY.
02:45	YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT?
02:47	I THINK I JUST NEED SOME REST.
02:49	YOU GUYS WANT TO HEAR ABOUT MY DREAM?
02:52	THAT'S OK.
02:53	I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYWAY.
02:57	[GRUMBLES]
03:00	LOOK AT THOSE CLEAR SKIES, BUDDY.
03:02	SHOULD BE SOME SMOOTH FLYING.
03:05	WELL, WE'D BETTER SMOOTHLY FLY OURSELVES TO A MARKET,
03:09	BECAUSE WE'RE OUT OF FOOD.
03:10	GUYS, WAIT. THIS WAS IN MY DREAM.
03:12	WE SHOULDN'T GO TO THE MARKET.
03:14	WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR DREAM?
03:15	FOOD EATS PEOPLE!
03:18	ALSO, MOMO COULD TALK.
03:20	YOU SAID SOME VERY UNKIND THINGS.
03:22	[CHITTERS]
03:27	[SNIFFS]
03:29	THERE IS A STORM COMING.
03:31	A BIG ONE.
03:33	YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND, UNCLE.
03:35	THE WEATHER IS PERFECT. THERE'S NOT A CLOUD IN SIGHT.
03:37	A STORM IS APPROACHING FROM THE NORTH.
03:41	I SUGGEST WE ALTER OUR COURSE AND HEAD SOUTHWEST.
03:44	WE KNOW THE AVATAR IS TRAVELING NORTHWARD,
03:46	SO WE WILL DO THE SAME.
03:48	PRINCE ZUKO, CONSIDER THE SAFETY OF THE CREW.
03:51	THE SAFETY OF THE CREW DOESN'T MATTER.
03:57	FINDING THE AVATAR IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT
04:00	THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL'S SAFETY.
04:06	HE DOESN'T MEAN THAT. HE'S JUST ALL WORKED UP.
04:13	IT'S GOOD. IT'S PERFECT, I'M TELLING YOU.
04:15	[SWISHES]
04:17	I DON'T KNOW IF I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT SWISHING.
04:20	SWISHING MEANS IT'S RIPE.
04:21	IT'S THE RIPE JUICES SWISHING AROUND, HUH?
04:25	I THINK IT'S TRUE, KATARA.
04:26	SWISHING MEANS IT'S RIPE.
04:28	I JUST REALIZED WE'RE OUT OF MONEY, ANYWAY.
04:31	AWW...
04:37	OUT OF FOOD AND OUT OF MONEY.
04:39	NOW WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?
04:40	YOU COULD GET A JOB, SMART GUY.
04:42	Woman: WE SHOULDN'T GO OUT THERE.
04:44	PLEASE! THE FISH CAN WAIT.
04:46	THERE'S GOING TO BE A TERRIBLE STORM.
04:48	AW, YOU'RE CRAZY. IT'S A NICE DAY.
04:50	NO CLOUDS, NO WIND, NO NOTHING,
04:52	SO QUIT YOUR NAGGING, WOMAN.
04:54	MAYBE WE SHOULD FIND SOME SHELTER.
04:57	ARE YOU KIDDING? SHELTER FROM WHAT?
05:00	Woman: MY JOINTS SAY THERE'S GOING TO BE A STORM,
05:02	A BAD ONE.
05:04	WELL, IT'S YOUR JOINTS AGAINST MY BRAIN.
05:07	THEN I HOPE YOUR BRAIN CAN FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO HAUL THAT FISH,
05:09	'CAUSE I AIN'T COMING!
05:11	THEN I'LL FIND A NEW FISH HAULER
05:13	AND PAY HIM DOUBLE WHAT YOU GET.
05:14	HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
05:15	I'LL GO.
05:16	YOU'RE HIRED.
05:19	WHAT? YOU SAID GET A JOB.
05:21	AND HE'S PAYING DOUBLE.
05:23	DOUBLE? WHO TOLD YOU THAT NONSENSE?
05:31	OH. LOOKS LIKE YOUR UNCLE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE STORM AFTER ALL.
05:34	LUCKY GUESS.
05:36	LIEUTENANT, YOU'D BETTER LEARN SOME RESPECT,
05:39	OR I WILL TEACH IT TO YOU.
05:42	WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT RESPECT?
05:46	THE WAY YOU TALK TO EVERYONE AROUND HERE,
05:49	FROM YOUR HARD-WORKING CREW TO YOUR ESTEEMED UNCLE,
05:51	SHOWS YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT RESPECT.
05:55	YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE BUT YOURSELF.
05:58	THEN AGAIN, WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT FROM A SPOILED PRINCE?
06:06	EASY NOW.
06:11	ENOUGH!
06:12	WE'RE ALL A BIT TIRED FROM BEING AT SEA SO LONG.
06:16	I'M SURE AFTER A BOWL OF NOODLES,
06:19	EVERYONE WILL FEEL MUCH BETTER.
06:25	I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP KEEPING ORDER ON MY SHIP.
06:36	SOKKA, MAYBE THIS ISN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
06:38	LOOK AT THE SKY.
06:40	I SAID I WAS GONNA DO THIS JOB.
06:42	I CAN'T BACK OUT JUST BECAUSE OF SOME BAD WEATHER.
06:45	Woman: THE BOY WITH THE TATTOOS HAS SOME SENSE.
06:47	YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM.
06:48	BOY WITH TATTOOS?
06:50	AIRBENDER TATTOOS.
06:53	WELL, I'LL BE A HOG MONKEY'S UNCLE.
06:56	YOU'RE THE AVATAR, AIN'T YOU?
06:57	THAT'S RIGHT.
06:59	WELL, DON'T BE SO SMILEY ABOUT IT.
07:02	THE AVATAR DISAPPEARED FOR A HUNDRED YEARS!
07:05	YOU TURNED YOUR BACK ON THE WORLD.
07:07	DON'T YELL AT HIM!
07:08	AANG WOULD NEVER TURN HIS BACK ON ANYONE.
07:11	OH, HE WOULDN'T, HUH?
07:13	THEN I GUESS I MUST HAVE IMAGINED
07:15	THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS OF WAR AND SUFFERING.
07:18	AANG IS THE BRAVEST PERSON I KNOW.
07:21	HE HAS DONE NOTHING BUT HELP PEOPLE
07:22	AND SAVE LIVES SINCE I MET HIM.
07:25	IT'S NOT HIS FAULT HE DISAPPEARED, RIGHT, AANG?
07:28	AANG, WHAT'S WRONG?
07:32	THAT'S RIGHT! KEEP FLYING!
07:35	YOU'RE A HORRIBLE OLD MAN!
07:36	EHH!
07:41	APPA, YIP, YIP.
07:43	UHH!
07:45	HEY! THEY LEFT WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.
07:46	YOUR FRIENDS AIN'T TOO POLITE, ARE THEY?
07:48	I KNOW. THIS ONE TIME, I WAS--
07:50	YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. GET BELOW DECK.
08:12	I'M SORRY FOR RUNNING AWAY.
08:14	IT'S OK. THAT FISHERMAN WAS WAY OUT OF LINE.
08:17	ACTUALLY, HE WASN'T.
08:19	WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
08:22	I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
08:24	IT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR DREAM, DOESN'T IT?
08:26	TALK TO ME.
08:28	WELL, IT'S KIND OF A LONG STORY.
08:31	[APPA GRUMBLING]
08:36	I'M GONNA TRY TO GET A LITTLE FIRE GOING.
08:42	I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAY THE MONKS TOLD ME I WAS THE AVATAR.
08:47	I WAS PLAYING WITH SOME OTHER KIDS JUST OUTSIDE THE SOUTH WALL.
08:51	I WAS TRYING TO TEACH THEM HOW TO DO THE AIR SCOOTER.
08:53	FIRST YOU FORM A BALL. THEN YOU'VE GOT TO GET ON QUICK.
08:58	HA HA HA!
09:00	YEAH! HA HA HA!
09:02	WHOO-HOO! YEAH!
09:04	OK, HERE GOES.
09:06	QUICK. GET ON.
09:08	WHOA. WHOA...
09:10	UHH!
09:12	YOU KIND OF HAVE TO BALANCE ON IT LIKE IT'S A TOP.
09:14	MAN, THAT'S HARD.
09:16	WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT TRICK, AANG?
09:18	I MADE IT UP.
09:19	WOW!
09:21	Gyatso: AANG, COME WITH US.
09:23	WE NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
09:32	Aang: HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S ME?
09:34	WE HAVE KNOWN YOU WERE THE AVATAR FOR SOME TIME.
09:38	DO YOU REMEMBER THESE?
09:44	THOSE WERE SOME OF MY FAVORITE TOYS WHEN I WAS LITTLE.
09:47	YOU CHOSE THEM FROM AMONG THOUSANDS OF TOYS, AANG.
09:50	THE TOYS YOU PICKED WERE THE 4 AVATAR RELICS.
09:54	THESE ITEMS BELONGED TO AVATARS PAST.
09:57	YOUR OWN PAST LIVES.
10:00	I JUST CHOSE THEM BECAUSE THEY SEEMED FUN.
10:02	YOU CHOSE THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE FAMILIAR.
10:06	NORMALLY, WE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU OF YOUR IDENTITY
10:08	WHEN YOU TURNED 16.
10:10	BUT THERE ARE TROUBLING SIGNS.
10:13	STORM CLOUDS ARE GATHERING.
10:16	I FEAR THAT WAR MAY BE UPON US, YOUNG AVATAR.
10:20	WE NEED YOU, AANG.
10:29	I'M SICK OF TAKING HIS ORDERS,
10:31	AND I'M TIRED OF CHASING HIS AVATAR.
10:33	I MEAN, WHO DOES ZUKO THINK HE IS?
10:36	DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW?
10:38	GENERAL IROH, WE WERE JUST--
10:40	IT'S OK.
10:41	MAY I JOIN YOU?
10:43	OF COURSE, SIR.
10:48	TRY TO UNDERSTAND,
10:49	MY NEPHEW IS A COMPLICATED YOUNG MAN.
10:52	HE HAS BEEN THROUGH MUCH.
11:00	LET ME IN!
11:02	PRINCE ZUKO, WHAT'S WRONG?
11:03	I WANT TO GO INTO THE WAR CHAMBER,
11:05	BUT THE GUARD WON'T LET ME PASS.
11:07	YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING. TRUST ME.
11:10	THESE MEETINGS ARE DREADFULLY BORING.
11:13	IF I'M GOING TO RULE THIS NATION ONE DAY,
11:15	DON'T YOU THINK I NEED TO START LEARNING AS MUCH AS I CAN?
11:18	VERY WELL, BUT YOU MUST PROMISE NOT TO SPEAK.
11:22	THESE OLD FOLKS ARE A BIT SENSITIVE, YOU KNOW?
11:25	THANK YOU, UNCLE.
11:33	THE EARTH KINGDOM DEFENSES ARE CONCENTRATED HERE,
11:37	A DANGEROUS BATTALION OF THEIR STRONGEST EARTHBENDERS
11:39	AND FIERCEST WARRIORS.
11:41	SO I AM RECOMMENDING THE 41st DIVISION.
11:45	BUT THE 41st IS ENTIRELY NEW RECRUITS.
11:48	HOW DO YOU EXPECT THEM TO DEFEAT
11:49	A POWERFUL EARTH KINGDOM BATTALION?
11:51	I DON'T.
11:54	THEY'LL BE USED AS A DISTRACTION
11:55	WHILE WE MOUNT AN ATTACK FROM THE REAR.
11:58	WHAT BETTER TO USE AS BAIT THAN FRESH MEAT?
12:02	YOU CAN'T SACRIFICE AN ENTIRE DIVISION LIKE THAT.
12:04	THOSE SOLDIERS LOVE AND DEFEND OUR NATION.
12:07	HOW CAN YOU BETRAY THEM?
12:11	ZUKO WAS RIGHT, YOU SEE?
12:13	BUT IT WAS NOT HIS PLACE TO SPEAK OUT.
12:16	AND THERE WERE DIRE CONSEQUENCES.
12:22	SO YOU WERE UPSET THAT YOU WERE THE AVATAR?
12:24	WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE EXCITED ABOUT IT?
12:27	WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL ABOUT IT.
12:30	ALL I KNEW WAS THAT AFTER I FOUND OUT,
12:32	EVERYTHING BEGAN CHANGING.
12:34	HEY, NOT BAD.
12:36	YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN PRACTICING.
12:37	NOT ONLY THAT;
12:39	WE MADE UP A GAME YOU CAN PLAY WITH THE AIR SCOOTERS.
12:42	GREAT!
12:48	WHAT'S GOING ON?
12:49	NOW THAT YOU'RE THE AVATAR,
12:51	IT'S KIND OF AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE
12:52	FOR WHICHEVER TEAM YOU'RE ON.
12:54	BUT I'M STILL THE SAME.
12:56	NOTHING HAS CHANGED.
12:58	SO, WHAT? I CAN'T PLAY?
13:00	THAT'S THE ONLY FAIR WAY.
13:02	OH. OK.
13:05	SORRY, AANG.
13:08	OK, NOW, WHO WANTS TO HAVE JINJU ON THEIR TEAM?
13:10	[LAUGHS]
13:20	VERY INTERESTING MOVE, YOUNG ONE.
13:23	WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
13:29	HEY! HA HA HA!
13:31	HA HA HA!
13:35	YOU'RE PLAYING GAMES WITH HIM?
13:36	THE AVATAR SHOULD BE TRAINING.
13:38	AANG HAS ALREADY TRAINED ENOUGH FOR TODAY.
13:41	TIME IS SHORT. COME WITH ME.
13:44	I MUST TEST YOU ON SOME HIGH-LEVEL TECHNIQUES.
13:47	NO. AS LONG AS I AM HIS GUARDIAN,
13:49	I WILL DECIDE WHEN HE TRAINS
13:51	AND WHEN HE GETS HIS BUTT KICKED AT PAI-SHO.
13:54	HMMPH!
14:02	AFTER ZUKO'S OUTBURST IN THE MEETING,
14:05	THE FIRE LORD BECAME VERY ANGRY WITH HIM.
14:10	HE SAID THAT PRINCE ZUKO'S CHALLENGE OF THE GENERAL
14:13	WAS AN ACT OF COMPLETE DISRESPECT.
14:17	AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO RESOLVE THIS.
14:21	AG NEE KAI.
14:22	A FIRE DUEL.
14:24	THAT'S RIGHT.
14:26	ZUKO LOOKED UPON THE OLD GENERAL HE HAD INSULTED
14:29	AND DECLARED THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID,
14:32	BUT ZUKO MISUNDERSTOOD.
14:35	WHEN HE TURNED TO FACE HIS OPPONENT,
14:37	HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE IT WAS NOT THE GENERAL.
14:41	ZUKO HAD SPOKEN OUT AGAINST THE GENERAL'S PLAN,
14:45	BUT BY DOING SO IN THE FIRE LORD'S WAR ROOM,
14:48	IT WAS THE FIRE LORD WHOM HE HAD DISRESPECTED.
14:52	ZUKO WOULD HAVE TO DUEL HIS OWN FATHER.
14:59	THEN, JUST WHEN I WAS STARTING TO FEEL BETTER,
15:02	SOMETHING WORSE HAPPENED.
15:04	AANG NEEDS TO HAVE FREEDOM AND FUN.
15:06	HE NEEDS TO GROW UP AS A NORMAL BOY.
15:10	HMM. YOU CANNOT KEEP PROTECTING HIM FROM HIS DESTINY.
15:13	GYATSO, I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL,
15:16	BUT YOU ARE LETTING YOUR AFFECTION FOR THE BOY CLOUD YOUR JUDGMENT.
15:20	ALL I WANT IS WHAT IS BEST FOR HIM.
15:23	BUT WHAT WE NEED IS WHAT'S BEST FOR THE WORLD.
15:29	YOU AND AANG MUST BE SEPARATED.
15:33	THE AVATAR WILL BE SENT AWAY TO THE EASTERN AIR TEMPLE
15:36	TO COMPLETE HIS TRAINING.
15:47	THAT'S AWFUL, AANG.
15:49	I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
15:51	HOW COULD THEY DO THAT TO ME?
15:53	THEY WANTED TO TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING I KNEW
15:54	AND EVERYONE I LOVED!
15:56	WHOA! HOT CINDERS.
15:59	I'M SORRY I GOT SO MAD.
16:02	YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE ANGRY
16:03	AFTER THE MONKS SENT YOU AWAY LIKE THAT.
16:05	WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
16:08	[LAUGHTER]
16:13	I WAS AFRAID AND CONFUSED.
16:15	I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
16:23	AANG?
16:25	I'M NOT GOING TO LET THEM TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ME.
16:28	AANG?
16:33	[GASPS]
16:37	I NEVER SAW GYATSO AGAIN.
16:40	[SCREAMS]
16:46	[ROARING]
16:55	NEXT THING I KNEW, I WAS WAKING UP IN YOUR ARMS
16:57	AFTER YOU FOUND ME IN THE ICEBERG.
17:03	YOU RAN AWAY.
17:04	AND THEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED OUR TEMPLE.
17:07	MY PEOPLE NEEDED ME, AND I WASN'T THERE TO HELP.
17:09	YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE--
17:11	THE WORLD NEEDED ME, AND I WASN'T THERE TO HELP.
17:13	AANG--
17:13	THE FISHERMAN WAS RIGHT.
17:15	I DID TURN MY BACK ON THE WORLD.
17:17	YOU'RE BEING TOO HARD ON YOURSELF.
17:19	EVEN IF YOU DID RUN AWAY,
17:21	I THINK IT WAS MEANT TO BE.
17:23	IF YOU HAD STAYED, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED
17:25	ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER AIRBENDERS.
17:27	YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
17:28	I KNOW IT'S MEANT TO BE THIS WAY.
17:30	THE WORLD NEEDS YOU NOW.
17:34	YOU GIVE PEOPLE HOPE.
17:39	[CHITTERS]
17:41	Iroh: WHEN PRINCE ZUKO SAW THAT IT WAS HIS FATHER
17:44	WHO HAD COME TO DUEL HIM,
17:46	HE BEGGED FOR MERCY.
17:49	PLEASE, FATHER,
17:51	I ONLY HAD THE FIRE NATION'S BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.
17:53	I'M SORRY I SPOKE OUT OF TURN.
17:55	YOU WILL FIGHT FOR YOUR HONOR.
17:58	I MEANT YOU NO DISRESPECT.
18:00	I AM YOUR LOYAL SON.
18:02	RISE AND FIGHT, PRINCE ZUKO.
18:05	I WON'T FIGHT YOU.
18:07	YOU WILL LEARN RESPECT,
18:10	AND SUFFERING WILL BE YOUR TEACHER.
18:15	Iroh, voice-over: I LOOKED AWAY.
18:17	[PRINCE ZUKO SCREAMING]
18:22	I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT PRINCE ZUKO WAS IN A TRAINING ACCIDENT.
18:27	IT WAS NO ACCIDENT.
18:30	AFTER THE DUEL,
18:32	THE FIRE LORD SAID THAT BY REFUSING TO FIGHT,
18:35	ZUKO HAD SHOWN SHAMEFUL WEAKNESS.
18:39	AS PUNISHMENT HE WAS BANISHED
18:42	AND SENT TO CAPTURE THE AVATAR.
18:45	ONLY THEN COULD HE RETURN WITH HIS HONOR.
18:49	SO THAT'S WHY HE'S SO OBSESSED.
18:52	CAPTURING THE AVATAR IS THE ONLY CHANCE HE HAS
18:54	OF THINGS RETURNING TO NORMAL.
18:57	THINGS WILL NEVER RETURN TO NORMAL,
18:59	BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
19:02	THE AVATAR GIVES ZUKO HOPE.
19:21	HELP! OH, PLEASE, HELP!
19:24	IT'S OK. YOU'RE SAFE.
19:26	BUT MY HUSBAND ISN'T.
19:28	WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHERE'S SOKKA?
19:30	THEY HAVEN'T RETURNED.
19:32	THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK BY NOW.
19:34	AND THIS STORM IS BECOMING A TYPHOON.
19:36	THEY'RE CAUGHT OUT AT SEA!
19:38	I'M GOING TO FIND THEM.
19:39	I'M GOING WITH YOU.
19:41	I'M STAYING HERE.
19:44	WE'LL BE BACK SOON. I PROMISE.
19:47	[GRUMBLING]
19:54	WHERE WERE WE HIT?
19:55	I DON'T KNOW.
19:56	LOOK!
19:58	Prince Zuko: THE HELMSMAN!
20:16	AAH!
20:28	WHERE ARE THEY?
20:32	COME ON, APPA!
20:45	THE BOAT! THERE!
20:50	THE AVATAR!
20:51	WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, SIR?
20:54	LET HIM GO.
20:56	WE NEED TO GET THIS SHIP TO SAFETY.
20:58	THEN WE MUST HEAD DIRECTLY INTO THE EYE OF THE STORM.
21:10	I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE!
21:12	I'M NOT, BUT I STILL DON'T WANT TO!
21:22	[GASPS]
21:29	HANG ON TO THE ROPE!
21:35	WHOA!
21:35	WHOA!
21:43	[GASP]
22:24	UNCLE, I AM SORRY.
22:26	YOUR APOLOGY IS ACCEPTED.
22:49	OH! YOU'RE ALIVE!
22:52	YOU OWE THIS BOY AN APOLOGY.
22:54	HE DOESN'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.
22:56	WHAT IF, INSTEAD OF AN APOLOGY,
22:59	I GIVE HIM A FREE FISH, AND WE CALL IT EVEN?
23:01	ACTUALLY, I DON'T EAT MEAT.
23:03	FISH AIN'T MEAT.
23:05	SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE STILL GONNA PAY ME, RIGHT?
23:08	AAH!
23:10	KATARA, I THINK YOU WERE RIGHT BEFORE.
23:12	I'M DONE DWELLING ON THE PAST.
23:13	REALLY?
23:15	I CAN'T MAKE GUESSES ABOUT HOW THINGS WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT
23:16	IF I HADN'T RUN AWAY.
23:18	I'M HERE NOW, AND I'M GOING TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT.
23:21	I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THOSE NIGHTMARES ANYMORE.
23:24	IF YOU WEREN'T HERE NOW,
23:26	WELL, I GUESS I WOULDN'T BE, EITHER.
23:29	THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE, AVATAR.
23:33	DO YOU HEAR THAT?
23:35	IT STOPPED RAINING.
23:41	[GRUMBLES]
23:43	Aang: UH! APPA!
