00:10	katara: water.
00:11	earth.
00:13	fire.
00:15	air.
00:17	long ago, the 4 nations lived together in harmony.
00:22	then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
00:26	only the avatar, master of all 4 elements,
00:29	could stop them.
00:30	but when the world needed him most, he vanished.
00:33	100 years passed,
00:35	and my brother and i discovered the new avatar,
00:37	an airbender named aang.
00:39	and although his airbending skills are great,
00:41	he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
00:45	but i believe aang can save the world.
00:58	this whole avatar thing.
01:00	maybe the monks made a mistake.
01:02	why didn't you tell us you were the avatar?
01:05	because...
01:07	i never wanted to be.
01:09	you're just a banished prince.
01:11	your own father doesn't even want you.
01:13	that's not true.
01:15	you have the scar to prove it.
01:17	have you forgotten what happened
01:19	last time you dueled the master?
01:21	i will never forget.
01:51	katara: we need you, aang.
01:53	i need you, too.
02:00	be careful, guys!
02:03	guys?
02:05	gyatso?
02:07	gyatso: why did you disappear?
02:09	i didn't mean to.
02:16	we need you, aang.
02:19	[aang screams]
02:24	voices: we need you, aang. we need you.
02:27	we need you, aang. we need you.
02:30	[momo chitters]
02:32	huh! what's going on?
02:33	did we get captured again?
02:35	it's nothing. i just had a bad dream.
02:37	go back to sleep.
02:39	you don't have to tell me twice.
02:40	are you all right, aang?
02:42	i'm ok.
02:44	you seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately.
02:45	you want to tell me about it?
02:47	i think i just need some rest.
02:49	you guys want to hear about my dream?
02:52	that's ok.
02:53	i didn't want to talk about it anyway.
02:57	[grumbles]
03:00	look at those clear skies, buddy.
03:02	should be some smooth flying.
03:05	well, we'd better smoothly fly ourselves to a market,
03:09	because we're out of food.
03:10	guys, wait. this was in my dream.
03:12	we shouldn't go to the market.
03:14	what happened in your dream?
03:15	food eats people!
03:18	also, momo could talk.
03:20	you said some very unkind things.
03:22	[chitters]
03:27	[sniffs]
03:29	there is a storm coming.
03:31	a big one.
03:33	you're out of your mind, uncle.
03:35	the weather is perfect. there's not a cloud in sight.
03:37	a storm is approaching from the north.
03:41	i suggest we alter our course and head southwest.
03:44	we know the avatar is traveling northward,
03:46	so we will do the same.
03:48	prince zuko, consider the safety of the crew.
03:51	the safety of the crew doesn't matter.
03:57	finding the avatar is far more important
04:00	than any individual's safety.
04:06	he doesn't mean that. he's just all worked up.
04:13	it's good. it's perfect, i'm telling you.
04:15	[swishes]
04:17	i don't know if i like the sound of that swishing.
04:20	swishing means it's ripe.
04:21	it's the ripe juices swishing around, huh?
04:25	i think it's true, katara.
04:26	swishing means it's ripe.
04:28	i just realized we're out of money, anyway.
04:31	aww...
04:37	out of food and out of money.
04:39	now what are we supposed to do?
04:40	you could get a job, smart guy.
04:42	woman: we shouldn't go out there.
04:44	please! the fish can wait.
04:46	there's going to be a terrible storm.
04:48	aw, you're crazy. it's a nice day.
04:50	no clouds, no wind, no nothing,
04:52	so quit your nagging, woman.
04:54	maybe we should find some shelter.
04:57	are you kidding? shelter from what?
05:00	woman: my joints say there's going to be a storm,
05:02	a bad one.
05:04	well, it's your joints against my brain.
05:07	then i hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish,
05:09	'cause i ain't coming!
05:11	then i'll find a new fish hauler
05:13	and pay him double what you get.
05:14	how do you like that?
05:15	i'll go.
05:16	you're hired.
05:19	what? you said get a job.
05:21	and he's paying double.
05:23	double? who told you that nonsense?
05:31	oh. looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all.
05:34	lucky guess.
05:36	lieutenant, you'd better learn some respect,
05:39	or i will teach it to you.
05:42	what do you know about respect?
05:46	the way you talk to everyone around here,
05:49	from your hard-working crew to your esteemed uncle,
05:51	shows you know nothing about respect.
05:55	you don't care about anyone but yourself.
05:58	then again, what should i expect from a spoiled prince?
06:06	easy now.
06:11	enough!
06:12	we're all a bit tired from being at sea so long.
06:16	i'm sure after a bowl of noodles,
06:19	everyone will feel much better.
06:25	i don't need your help keeping order on my ship.
06:36	sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea.
06:38	look at the sky.
06:40	i said i was gonna do this job.
06:42	i can't back out just because of some bad weather.
06:45	woman: the boy with the tattoos has some sense.
06:47	you should listen to him.
06:48	boy with tattoos?
06:50	airbender tattoos.
06:53	well, i'll be a hog monkey's uncle.
06:56	you're the avatar, ain't you?
06:57	that's right.
06:59	well, don't be so smiley about it.
07:02	the avatar disappeared for a hundred years!
07:05	you turned your back on the world.
07:07	don't yell at him!
07:08	aang would never turn his back on anyone.
07:11	oh, he wouldn't, huh?
07:13	then i guess i must have imagined
07:15	the last hundred years of war and suffering.
07:18	aang is the bravest person i know.
07:21	he has done nothing but help people
07:22	and save lives since i met him.
07:25	it's not his fault he disappeared, right, aang?
07:28	aang, what's wrong?
07:32	that's right! keep flying!
07:35	you're a horrible old man!
07:36	ehh!
07:41	appa, yip, yip.
07:43	uhh!
07:45	hey! they left without saying good-bye.
07:46	your friends ain't too polite, are they?
07:48	i know. this one time, i was--
07:50	yeah, yeah, yeah. get below deck.
08:12	i'm sorry for running away.
08:14	it's ok. that fisherman was way out of line.
08:17	actually, he wasn't.
08:19	what do you mean?
08:22	i don't want to talk about it.
08:24	it has to do with your dream, doesn't it?
08:26	talk to me.
08:28	well, it's kind of a long story.
08:31	[appa grumbling]
08:36	i'm gonna try to get a little fire going.
08:42	i'll never forget the day the monks told me i was the avatar.
08:47	i was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall.
08:51	i was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter.
08:53	first you form a ball. then you've got to get on quick.
08:58	ha ha ha!
09:00	yeah! ha ha ha!
09:02	whoo-hoo! yeah!
09:04	ok, here goes.
09:06	quick. get on.
09:08	whoa. whoa...
09:10	uhh!
09:12	you kind of have to balance on it like it's a top.
09:14	man, that's hard.
09:16	where did you learn that trick, aang?
09:18	i made it up.
09:19	wow!
09:21	gyatso: aang, come with us.
09:23	we need to speak with you.
09:32	aang: how do you know it's me?
09:34	we have known you were the avatar for some time.
09:38	do you remember these?
09:44	those were some of my favorite toys when i was little.
09:47	you chose them from among thousands of toys, aang.
09:50	the toys you picked were the 4 avatar relics.
09:54	these items belonged to avatars past.
09:57	your own past lives.
10:00	i just chose them because they seemed fun.
10:02	you chose them because they were familiar.
10:06	normally, we would have told you of your identity
10:08	when you turned 16.
10:10	but there are troubling signs.
10:13	storm clouds are gathering.
10:16	i fear that war may be upon us, young avatar.
10:20	we need you, aang.
10:29	i'm sick of taking his orders,
10:31	and i'm tired of chasing his avatar.
10:33	i mean, who does zuko think he is?
10:36	do you really want to know?
10:38	general iroh, we were just--
10:40	it's ok.
10:41	may i join you?
10:43	of course, sir.
10:48	try to understand,
10:49	my nephew is a complicated young man.
10:52	he has been through much.
11:00	let me in!
11:02	prince zuko, what's wrong?
11:03	i want to go into the war chamber,
11:05	but the guard won't let me pass.
11:07	you're not missing anything. trust me.
11:10	these meetings are dreadfully boring.
11:13	if i'm going to rule this nation one day,
11:15	don't you think i need to start learning as much as i can?
11:18	very well, but you must promise not to speak.
11:22	these old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?
11:25	thank you, uncle.
11:33	the earth kingdom defenses are concentrated here,
11:37	a dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders
11:39	and fiercest warriors.
11:41	so i am recommending the 41st division.
11:45	but the 41st is entirely new recruits.
11:48	how do you expect them to defeat
11:49	a powerful earth kingdom battalion?
11:51	i don't.
11:54	they'll be used as a distraction
11:55	while we mount an attack from the rear.
11:58	what better to use as bait than fresh meat?
12:02	you can't sacrifice an entire division like that.
12:04	those soldiers love and defend our nation.
12:07	how can you betray them?
12:11	zuko was right, you see?
12:13	but it was not his place to speak out.
12:16	and there were dire consequences.
12:22	so you were upset that you were the avatar?
12:24	why wouldn't you be excited about it?
12:27	well, i didn't know how to feel about it.
12:30	all i knew was that after i found out,
12:32	everything began changing.
12:34	hey, not bad.
12:36	you guys have been practicing.
12:37	not only that;
12:39	we made up a game you can play with the air scooters.
12:42	great!
12:48	what's going on?
12:49	now that you're the avatar,
12:51	it's kind of an unfair advantage
12:52	for whichever team you're on.
12:54	but i'm still the same.
12:56	nothing has changed.
12:58	so, what? i can't play?
13:00	that's the only fair way.
13:02	oh. ok.
13:05	sorry, aang.
13:08	ok, now, who wants to have jinju on their team?
13:10	[laughs]
13:20	very interesting move, young one.
13:23	what do you mean?
13:29	hey! ha ha ha!
13:31	ha ha ha!
13:35	you're playing games with him?
13:36	the avatar should be training.
13:38	aang has already trained enough for today.
13:41	time is short. come with me.
13:44	i must test you on some high-level techniques.
13:47	no. as long as i am his guardian,
13:49	i will decide when he trains
13:51	and when he gets his butt kicked at pai-sho.
13:54	hmmph!
14:02	after zuko's outburst in the meeting,
14:05	the fire lord became very angry with him.
14:10	he said that prince zuko's challenge of the general
14:13	was an act of complete disrespect.
14:17	and there was only one way to resolve this.
14:21	ag nee kai.
14:22	a fire duel.
14:24	that's right.
14:26	zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted
14:29	and declared that he was not afraid,
14:32	but zuko misunderstood.
14:35	when he turned to face his opponent,
14:37	he was surprised to see it was not the general.
14:41	zuko had spoken out against the general's plan,
14:45	but by doing so in the fire lord's war room,
14:48	it was the fire lord whom he had disrespected.
14:52	zuko would have to duel his own father.
14:59	then, just when i was starting to feel better,
15:02	something worse happened.
15:04	aang needs to have freedom and fun.
15:06	he needs to grow up as a normal boy.
15:10	hmm. you cannot keep protecting him from his destiny.
15:13	gyatso, i know you mean well,
15:16	but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment.
15:20	all i want is what is best for him.
15:23	but what we need is what's best for the world.
15:29	you and aang must be separated.
15:33	the avatar will be sent away to the eastern air temple
15:36	to complete his training.
15:47	that's awful, aang.
15:49	i don't know what to say.
15:51	how could they do that to me?
15:53	they wanted to take away everything i knew
15:54	and everyone i loved!
15:56	whoa! hot cinders.
15:59	i'm sorry i got so mad.
16:02	you have a right to be angry
16:03	after the monks sent you away like that.
16:05	well, that's not exactly what happened.
16:08	[laughter]
16:13	i was afraid and confused.
16:15	i didn't know what to do.
16:23	aang?
16:25	i'm not going to let them take you away from me.
16:28	aang?
16:33	[gasps]
16:37	i never saw gyatso again.
16:40	[screams]
16:46	[roaring]
16:55	next thing i knew, i was waking up in your arms
16:57	after you found me in the iceberg.
17:03	you ran away.
17:04	and then the fire nation attacked our temple.
17:07	my people needed me, and i wasn't there to help.
17:09	you don't know what would have--
17:11	the world needed me, and i wasn't there to help.
17:13	aang--
17:13	the fisherman was right.
17:15	i did turn my back on the world.
17:17	you're being too hard on yourself.
17:19	even if you did run away,
17:21	i think it was meant to be.
17:23	if you had stayed, you would have been killed
17:25	along with all the other airbenders.
17:27	you don't know that.
17:28	i know it's meant to be this way.
17:30	the world needs you now.
17:34	you give people hope.
17:39	[chitters]
17:41	iroh: when prince zuko saw that it was his father
17:44	who had come to duel him,
17:46	he begged for mercy.
17:49	please, father,
17:51	i only had the fire nation's best interests at heart.
17:53	i'm sorry i spoke out of turn.
17:55	you will fight for your honor.
17:58	i meant you no disrespect.
18:00	i am your loyal son.
18:02	rise and fight, prince zuko.
18:05	i won't fight you.
18:07	you will learn respect,
18:10	and suffering will be your teacher.
18:15	iroh, voice-over: i looked away.
18:17	[prince zuko screaming]
18:22	i always thought that prince zuko was in a training accident.
18:27	it was no accident.
18:30	after the duel,
18:32	the fire lord said that by refusing to fight,
18:35	zuko had shown shameful weakness.
18:39	as punishment he was banished
18:42	and sent to capture the avatar.
18:45	only then could he return with his honor.
18:49	so that's why he's so obsessed.
18:52	capturing the avatar is the only chance he has
18:54	of things returning to normal.
18:57	things will never return to normal,
18:59	but the important thing is,
19:02	the avatar gives zuko hope.
19:21	help! oh, please, help!
19:24	it's ok. you're safe.
19:26	but my husband isn't.
19:28	what do you mean? where's sokka?
19:30	they haven't returned.
19:32	they should have been back by now.
19:34	and this storm is becoming a typhoon.
19:36	they're caught out at sea!
19:38	i'm going to find them.
19:39	i'm going with you.
19:41	i'm staying here.
19:44	we'll be back soon. i promise.
19:47	[grumbling]
19:54	where were we hit?
19:55	i don't know.
19:56	look!
19:58	prince zuko: the helmsman!
20:16	aah!
20:28	where are they?
20:32	come on, appa!
20:45	the boat! there!
20:50	the avatar!
20:51	what do you want to do, sir?
20:54	let him go.
20:56	we need to get this ship to safety.
20:58	then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.
21:10	i'm too young to die!
21:12	i'm not, but i still don't want to!
21:22	[gasps]
21:29	hang on to the rope!
21:35	whoa!
21:35	whoa!
21:43	[gasp]
22:24	uncle, i am sorry.
22:26	your apology is accepted.
22:49	oh! you're alive!
22:52	you owe this boy an apology.
22:54	he doesn't have to apologize.
22:56	what if, instead of an apology,
22:59	i give him a free fish, and we call it even?
23:01	actually, i don't eat meat.
23:03	fish ain't meat.
23:05	seriously, you're still gonna pay me, right?
23:08	aah!
23:10	katara, i think you were right before.
23:12	i'm done dwelling on the past.
23:13	really?
23:15	i can't make guesses about how things would have turned out
23:16	if i hadn't run away.
23:18	i'm here now, and i'm going to make the most of it.
23:21	i don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore.
23:24	if you weren't here now,
23:26	well, i guess i wouldn't be, either.
23:29	thank you for saving my life, avatar.
23:33	do you hear that?
23:35	it stopped raining.
23:41	[grumbles]
23:43	aang: uh! appa!
