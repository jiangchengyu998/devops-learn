00:09	katara: water...

00:11	earth...

00:13	fire...

00:15	air.

00:17	long ago, the 4 nations lived together in harmony.

00:22	then, everything changed when the fire nation attacked.

00:26	only the avatar, master of all 4 elements,

00:29	could stop them.

00:30	but when the world needed him most,

00:32	he vanished.

00:33	100 years passed,

00:35	and my brother and i discovered the new avatar--

00:38	an airbender named aang.

00:39	and although his airbending skills are great,

00:41	he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

00:44	aang: oof!

00:46	but i believe aang can save the world.

00:57	aang: you're waterbender!

00:59	well, not yet.

01:01	if we go to the north pole,

01:02	you can master waterbending.

01:04	we can learn it together.

01:06	i lost my mother in a fire nation raid.

01:09	this necklace is all i have left of her.

01:14	roku: aang, you must defeat the fire lord

01:18	before the comet arrives.

01:20	but i haven't even started learning waterbending,

01:23	not to mention earth and fire.

01:25	mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice,

01:29	but if the world is to survive,

01:31	you must do it by summer's end.

01:47	[panting]

01:50	sokka: would you sit down?!

01:52	if we hit a bump, you'll go flying off!

01:54	what's bugging you anyway?

01:56	it's what avatar roku said.

01:57	i'm supposed to master all 4 elements

01:59	before that comet arrives.

02:01	well, let's see.

02:03	you pretty much mastered airbending,

02:04	and that only took you 112 years.

02:06	i'm sure you can master

02:07	3 more elements by next summer.

02:09	i haven't even started waterbending,

02:11	and we're still weeks away from the north pole.

02:13	what am i gonna do?!

02:14	calm down.

02:16	it's gonna be ok.

02:17	if you want,

02:19	i can try and teach you

02:20	some of the stuff i know.

02:21	you'd do that?

02:22	we'll need to find

02:24	a good source of water first.

02:26	maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.

02:30	nice puddle.

02:34	[snorting]

02:39	[screeches]

02:42	aang: yeah!

02:44	don't start without me, boy!

02:45	remember the reason we're here.

02:47	oh, right.

02:48	time to practice waterbending.

02:50	great. so, what am i supposed to do?

02:52	you could clean the gunk

02:54	out of appa's toes.

02:56	so, while you guys are playing in the water,

02:58	i'm supposed to be hard at work

03:00	picking mud out of a giant bison's feet?

03:02	mud and bugs.

03:05	ok.

03:12	[grunting]

03:15	whoa! whoa!

03:17	oof!

03:18	someone's changing our course.

03:22	what's the meaning of this mutiny?

03:23	no one told you to change course.

03:25	actually, someone did.

03:27	i assure you,

03:29	it is a matter of utmost importance,

03:31	prince zuko.

03:33	is it something to do with the avatar?

03:34	even more urgent.

03:36	it seems i--

03:37	i've lost my lotus tile.

03:40	lotus tile?

03:42	for my pai gow game.

03:44	most people think the lotus tile

03:46	insignificant.

03:48	but it is essential for the unusual strategy

03:51	that i employ.

03:53	you've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?

03:56	see, you, like most people,

03:58	underestimate its value.

04:00	just give me 10 minutes to check the merchants

04:02	at this port of call.

04:04	hopefully, they'll have the lotus tile in stock

04:07	and i can get on with my life.

04:10	[breathing deeply]

04:12	i'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.

04:18	[sighs]

04:19	yeah, don't get too happy.

04:20	you've got to do me next.

04:21	[sighs]

04:23	this is a pretty basic move,

04:25	but it still took me months to perfect.

04:27	so, don't be frustrated

04:29	if you don't get it right away.

04:31	just push and pull the water like this.

04:34	the key is getting the wrist movement right.

04:37	like this?

04:41	that's almost right.

04:43	if you keep practicing,

04:44	i'm sure eventually--

04:46	hey, i'm bending it already!

04:48	wow! i can't believe you got that so quickly.

04:50	it took me two months to learn that move.

04:52	well, you had to figure it out

04:54	all on your own.

04:55	i'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.

04:57	thanks.

04:58	so, what's next?

05:00	this is a more difficult move.

05:01	i call it streaming the water.

05:07	it's harder than it looks,

05:08	so don't be disappointed if...

05:20	nice work.

05:21	though the over-the-head flair was unnecessary.

05:24	sorry.

05:25	well, don't stop now.

05:26	keep 'em coming.

05:28	well, i kind of know this one other move,

05:30	but it's pretty hard.

05:32	i haven't even totally figured it out yet.

05:33	the idea is to create a big, powerful wave.

05:41	[grunts]

05:42	so, like this?

05:48	aang!

05:58	looks like i got the hang of that move.

05:59	what else you got?

06:01	that's enough practicing for today.

06:03	yeah, i'll say!

06:04	you just practiced our supplies

06:06	down the river.

06:07	uh, sorry.

06:09	i'm sure we can find some way

06:11	to replace all this stuff.

06:12	my life was hard enough

06:14	when you were just an airbender.

06:22	[people chattering]

06:25	man: please, put me down!

06:27	vender: see the wonder in this bag!

06:29	who's brave enough to look into this bag?!

06:32	wow!

06:36	we've got exactly 3 copper pieces left

06:38	from the money that king bumi gave us.

06:40	let's spend it wisely.

06:41	uh, make that two copper pieces, sokka.

06:44	i couldn't say no to this whistle.

06:47	[air hisses]

06:50	it doesn't even work.

06:51	[squeals]

06:53	see? even momo thinks it's a piece of junk.

06:56	no offense, aang,

06:58	but i'll hold the money from now on.

07:05	man: earth nation! fire nation!

07:07	water nation.

07:09	so long as bargains are your inclination,

07:11	you're welcome here!

07:13	don't be shy.

07:14	come on by!

07:16	oh, you there!

07:17	i can see from your clothing

07:20	that you're world traveling types.

07:22	perhaps i can interest you

07:23	in some exotic curios?

07:25	sure!

07:27	what are curios?

07:30	i'm not entirely sure,

07:32	but we got 'em.

07:38	[gasps]

07:39	huh?

07:49	man: i've never seen such a fine specimen of lemur.

07:54	that beast would fetch me a hefty sum

07:56	if you'd be interested in bartering.

07:58	[squawks]

08:00	[hisses]

08:02	momo's not for sale.

08:12	look at this, aang!

08:13	it's a waterbending scroll.

08:16	check out these crazy moves.

08:18	where did you get a waterbending scroll?

08:21	let's just say i got it up north

08:24	at a most reasonable price--

08:26	free.

08:30	wait a minute.

08:31	sea-loving traders

08:33	with suspiciously acquired merchandise

08:36	and pet reptile birds?

08:39	you guys are pirates!

08:41	we prefer to think of ourselves as

08:43	high-risk traders.

08:46	so, how much for the traded scroll?

08:49	i've already got a buyer--

08:50	a nobleman in the earth kingdom--

08:52	unless, of course, you kids have

08:55	200 gold pieces on you right now.

08:58	i know how to deal with these guys, katara.

09:00	pirates love to haggle.

09:03	watch and learn.

09:06	what say ye to the price of...

09:08	one copper piece?

09:11	ha ha ha ha!

09:13	the price is 200 gold pieces.

09:16	i don't haggle on items this rare.

09:18	ok, two copper pieces.

09:21	it's not as amusing the second time, boy.

09:24	aang, can we get out of here?

09:26	i feel like we're getting weird looks.

09:28	aye! we be casting off now!

09:31	what was that all about, katara?

09:33	yeah, i was just starting to browse through

09:35	their boomerang collection.

09:36	i'll just feel a lot better

09:38	once we get away from here.

09:39	hey, you!

09:40	get back here!

09:42	well, well.

09:43	look who's come to their senses.

09:45	told you the haggling would pay off.

09:46	[growling]

09:58	there they are!

09:59	get 'em!

10:00	nobody's going nowhere!

10:02	[laughing]

10:05	i don't think these pirates

10:07	are here to trade with us.

10:08	get back here!

10:10	you little--

10:12	come on!

10:13	this way.

10:14	let's cut 'em off!

10:17	whoa!

10:21	whoa!

10:22	oof!

10:28	oh! oh!

10:30	oh! oh!

10:36	[screaming]

10:37	my cabbages!

10:38	this place is worse than omashu!

10:41	[groaning]

10:47	aha!

10:49	[shudders]

10:51	i hope that lemur of yours

10:53	has 9 lives.

10:56	now, who gets to taste

10:59	the steel of my blade first?

11:01	no, thanks.

11:03	haa!

11:05	[screams]

11:06	grab on tight!

11:08	aang, i thought we were

11:09	running away from the pirates.

11:11	just hang on.

11:12	both: whoa!

11:14	ow!

11:16	whoa!

11:20	i used to kind of look up to pirates,

11:22	but those guys are terrible.

11:24	i know.

11:25	that's why i took this.

11:27	no way!

11:28	isn't it great?!

11:30	no wonder they were trying to hack us up.

11:32	you stole their waterbending scroll.

11:34	i prefer to think of it as

11:36	high-risk trading.

11:37	ha ha ha.

11:39	good one, katara.

11:40	sokka, where to you think they got it?

11:42	they stole it from a waterbender.

11:45	it doesn't matter.

11:46	you put all of our lives in danger

11:48	just so you could learn

11:49	some stupid, fancy splashes.

11:51	these are real waterbending forms.

11:54	you know how crucial it is

11:55	for aang to learn waterbending.

11:56	[sighs]

11:58	whatever.

11:59	well, what's done is done.

12:01	we have it.

12:02	we might as well learn from it.

12:12	i've checked all the shops on this pier.

12:15	not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.

12:19	it's good to know this trip

12:20	was a complete waste of time

12:22	for everyone!

12:23	quite the contrary.

12:24	i always say the only thing better than

12:27	finding something you are looking for

12:29	is finding something you weren't looking for

12:32	at a great bargain.

12:36	you bought a sungi horn?

12:37	for music night on the ship.

12:39	now, if we only had some woodwinds.

12:44	oh, this place looks promising.

12:47	oh, that is handsome!

12:50	wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?

12:52	we lost the water tribe girl

12:54	and the little bald monk

12:55	she was traveling with.

12:57	this monk, did he have an arrow on his head?

12:59	[imitates monkey]

13:01	i just want to try this one move first,

13:03	and then it's all yours.

13:04	here, hold it open for me.

13:09	the single water whip.

13:11	looks doable.

13:17	ow!

13:18	ha ha ha!

13:19	what's so funny?

13:21	i'm sorry, but you deserved that.

13:22	you've been duped.

13:24	she's only interested in teaching herself.

13:26	aang will get his turn

13:27	once i figure out the water whip.

13:32	[screeches]

13:33	ugh! why can't i get this stupid move?!

13:36	you'll get it.

13:39	you've just gotta shift your weight

13:41	through the stances.

13:42	there. see?

13:44	the key to bending is--

13:45	will you please shut your air hole!

13:47	believe it or not, your infinite wisdom

13:49	gets a little old sometimes!

13:51	why don't we just throw the scroll away

13:52	since you're so naturally gifted?!

13:56	what?!

14:00	oh, my gosh, aang.

14:02	i am so sorry.

14:05	i don't know what came over me.

14:06	but you know what?

14:08	it won't happen again.

14:09	here, this is yours.

14:11	i don't want to have

14:12	anything to do with it anymore.

14:14	it's ok, katara.

14:15	what about momo?

14:16	he's the real victim here.

14:18	i'm sorry, momo.

14:19	and what about me?

14:21	there was that time you--

14:22	no more apologies.

14:34	shouldn't we stop to search the woods?

14:36	we don't need to stop.

14:38	they stole a waterbending scroll, right?

14:40	mm-hmm.

14:41	then they'll be on the water.

15:00	[purrs]

15:03	shh.

15:05	momo, go back to sleep.

15:08	[coos]

15:09	shh!

15:18	[grunting]

15:21	shoot!

15:23	come on, water! work with me here!

15:25	ok, what if i--ow!

15:27	[distant yelling]

15:30	ok, katara,

15:31	shift your weight through the stances.

15:33	ugh!

15:34	[scraping]

15:38	[gasps]

15:41	ah! no!

15:42	let go of me!

15:44	[grunts]

15:46	i'll save you from the pirates.

15:56	tell me where he is,

15:57	and i won't hurt you or your brother.

15:58	go jump in the river!

16:01	try to understand,

16:03	i need to capture him

16:04	to restore something i've lost--

16:06	my honor.

16:07	perhaps in exchange,

16:09	i can restore something you've lost.

16:13	my mother's necklace.

16:15	how did you get that?!

16:16	i didn't steal it

16:18	if that's what you're wondering.

16:19	tell me where he is.

16:21	no!

16:23	enough of this necklace garbage.

16:24	you promised the scroll.

16:26	i wonder how much money this is worth.

16:29	[gasps]

16:29	no!

16:31	a lot, apparently.

16:33	now, you help me find what i want,

16:35	you'll get this back,

16:36	and everyone goes home happy.

16:38	search the woods for the boy and meet back here.

16:40	fine.

16:45	[groaning]

16:47	huh?

16:48	where did she go?

16:49	i don't believe it.

16:50	[yawns]

16:52	what's wrong?

16:53	she took the scroll.

16:54	she's obsessed with that thing.

16:56	it's just a matter of time

16:57	before she gets us all in deep--

16:58	whoa!

17:01	[screams]

17:03	[yells]

17:10	[grunts]

17:12	i've got him. come on!

17:13	oh, what? i'm not good enough to kidnap?

17:17	aagh!

17:21	nice work.

17:26	[straining]

17:29	aang, this is all my fault.

17:31	no, katara, it isn't.

17:32	yeah, it kind of is.

17:35	give me the boy.

17:36	you give us the scroll.

17:39	you're really gonna hand over the avatar

17:41	for a stupid piece of parchment?

17:43	don't listen to him.

17:45	he's trying to turn us against each other.

17:46	your friend is the avatar?

17:49	sure is.

17:50	and i'll bet he'll fetch a lot more

17:52	on the black market than that fancy scroll.

17:54	shut your mouth,

17:55	you water tribe peasant!

17:57	yeah, sokka, you really should shut your mouth.

18:00	i'm just saying,

18:01	it's bad business sense.

18:03	just imagine how much the fire lord

18:04	would pay for the avatar.

18:06	you guys would be set for life.

18:08	keep the scroll.

18:10	we can buy 100 with the reward

18:11	we'll get for the kid.

18:13	you'll regret breaking a deal with me.

18:17	[growls]

18:24	[screaming]

18:27	[yelling]

18:38	thanks, momo.

18:39	i owe you a bushel of apples.

18:42	[coughing]

18:45	[grunts]

19:07	hey!

19:10	[squawks]

19:13	[squawk]

19:17	[swords clanging]

19:21	aah!

19:22	aang, are you there?

19:24	i'm over here! follow my voice.

19:27	where? i can't find you!

19:29	i'm right here!

19:35	uh, never mind.

19:36	i'll find you!

19:38	run!

19:42	katara, you're ok.

19:44	help me get this boat back in the water

19:45	so we can get out of here.

19:47	[all straining]

19:51	we need a team of rhinos

19:52	to budge this ship.

19:53	a team of rhinos...

19:55	or two waterbenders.

20:07	katara: everybody in!

20:12	are you so busy fighting

20:13	you cannot see your own ship

20:15	has set sail?

20:17	we have no time for your proverbs, uncle.

20:19	it's no proverb.

20:22	bleeding hog monkeys!

20:24	ha ha ha ha!

20:27	[laughter]

20:30	hey, that's my boat!

20:33	maybe it should be a proverb.

20:35	come on, uncle.

20:39	sokka, can't you make it go any faster?

20:42	i don't know how.

20:43	this thing wasn't made by the water tribe.

20:47	[grunting]

20:52	whoa!

20:55	whoa!

21:01	oof!

21:03	hey! you did the water whip.

21:05	i couldn't have done it without your help.

21:06	will you two quit congratulating each other

21:08	and help me out?

21:23	[squeaking]

21:24	[screaming]

21:26	that's good.

21:28	wah!

21:30	hah!

21:31	[screaming]

21:37	aang, look!

21:41	oh, no!

21:48	[air hissing]

21:50	aah! oh!

21:52	have you lost your mind?

21:54	this is no time for flute practice!

21:58	we can stop the boat.

21:59	aang, together,

22:00	push and pull the water.

22:09	it's working.

22:10	it's slowing down.

22:19	we're doing it!

22:20	but we have another problem.

22:24	whoa!

22:24	whoa!

22:27	jump!

22:28	[screaming]

22:44	aang: i knew a bison whistle would come in handy.

22:46	thanks, appa.

22:48	sokka: yeah, we owe you one.

22:49	[grunts]

22:53	my boat!

23:00	prince zuko,

23:02	you're really going to get a kick out of this.

23:04	that lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!

23:09	[growling]

23:13	[grunts]

23:16	katara: aang,

23:18	i still owe you an apology.

23:20	you were just so good at waterbending

23:22	without really trying.

23:23	i got so competitive

23:25	that i put us all in danger.

23:27	i'm sorry.

23:28	that's ok, katara.

23:30	besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway?

23:33	is that really how you feel?

23:35	the scroll!

23:37	first, what did you learn?

23:38	stealing is wrong.

23:42	unless it's from pirates.

23:43	aang: ha ha ha!

23:45	good one, katara.
