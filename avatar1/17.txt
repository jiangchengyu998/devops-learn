00:09	Katara: WATER...
00:10	EARTH...
00:12	FIRE...
00:14	AIR.
00:16	LONG AGO, THE 4 NATIONS LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY.
00:20	THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED.
00:25	ONLY THE AVATAR, MASTER OF ALL 4 ELEMENTS,
00:28	COULD STOP THEM.
00:29	BUT WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED HIM MOST,
00:31	HE VANISHED.
00:32	100 YEARS PASSED,
00:34	AND MY BROTHER AND I DISCOVERED THE NEW AVATAR--
00:36	AN AIRBENDER NAMED AANG.
00:38	AND ALTHOUGH HIS AIRBENDING SKILLS ARE GREAT,
00:40	HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN BEFORE HE'S READY TO SAVE ANYONE.
00:43	Aang: OOF.
00:45	BUT I BELIEVE AANG CAN SAVE THE WORLD.
00:56	Aang: THERE IT IS--
00:58	THE SOUTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
01:00	THIS PLACE USED TO BE FULL OF MONKS
01:02	AND LEMURS AND BISON.
01:04	I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
01:07	[GRUNTING]
01:09	I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A KEY?
01:11	THE KEY, SOKKA, IS AIRBENDING.
01:16	AND IF FIREBENDERS FOUND THIS TEMPLE,
01:18	THAT MEANS THEY FOUND THE OTHER ONES, TOO.
01:20	I REALLY AM THE LAST AIRBENDER.
01:30	Man: SO, TRAVELERS, THE NEXT TIME YOU THINK YOU HEAR
01:34	A STRANGE LARGE BIRD TALKING,
01:37	TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. IT MIGHT NOT BE A GIANT PARROT, BUT A FLYING MAN,
01:44	A MEMBER OF A SECRET GROUP OF AIRWALKERS WHO LAUGH AT GRAVITY
01:49	AND LAUGH AT THOSE BOUND TO THE EARTH BY IT.
01:52	[MOMO COOING]
01:54	Aang: AREN'T AIRBENDER STORIES THE BEST?
01:56	Katara: WAS IT REALISTIC? IS THAT HOW IT WAS BACK THEN?
01:59	I LAUGH AT GRAVITY ALL THE TIME.
02:01	HA HA! GRAVITY.
02:03	JINGLE, JINGLE.
02:09	SORRY.
02:11	AW. CHEAPSKATES.
02:12	HEY, THANKS FOR THE STORY.
02:15	TELL IT TO THE CAP, BOY.
02:21	AW. MUCH OBLIGED, LITTLE BAT THING.
02:24	IT MEANS A LOT TO HEAR AIRBENDER STORIES.
02:26	IT MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
02:28	YOUR GREAT-GRANDPA MET THEM.
02:30	WHAT ARE YOU PRATTLING ABOUT, CHILD?
02:32	GREAT-GRANDPAPPY SAW THE AIRWALKERS LAST WEEK.
02:34	[GREAT-GRANDPA SPEAKS HOARSELY]
02:43	Aang: WE'RE ALMOST TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
02:45	THIS IS WHERE THEY HAD THE CHAMPIONSHIPS
02:47	FOR SKY BISON POLO.
02:49	DO YOU THINK WE'LL REALLY FIND AIRBENDERS?
02:52	YOU WANT ME TO BE LIKE YOU OR TOTALLY HONEST?
02:55	ARE YOU SAYING I'M A LIAR?
02:57	I'M SAYING YOU'RE AN OPTIMIST. SAME THING, BASICALLY.
02:59	HEY, GUYS, LOOK AT THIS!
03:10	THEY REALLY ARE AIRBENDERS!
03:13	NO, THEY'RE NOT.
03:15	WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THEY'RE NOT?
03:16	THOSE GUYS ARE FLYING!
03:18	GLIDING MAYBE, BUT NOT FLYING.
03:19	YOU CAN TELL BY THE WAY THEY MOVE
03:21	THEY'RE NOT AIRBENDING. THOSE PEOPLE HAVE NO SPIRIT.
03:27	OH!
03:27	OH!
03:28	[BOY CHUCKLING]
03:31	I DON'T KNOW, AANG. THAT KID SEEMED PRETTY SPIRITED.
03:44	OW!
03:46	WE'D BETTER FIND SOME SOLID GROUND
03:47	BEFORE IT FINDS US.
03:52	HA HA!
03:57	GO, TEO!
03:59	SHOW THAT BALD KID HOW IT'S DONE!
04:17	HEY THERE. YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD.
04:19	YEAH, I KNOW. BUT I CAN DO MORE THAN FANCY GLIDING.
04:38	WOW! I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT.
04:40	BUT HERE'S A GOOD ONE.
05:00	[KIDS CHEERING]
05:03	WHAT DO YOU THINK?
05:05	[DEADPAN] IT'S GREAT.
05:22	HEY, YOU'RE A REAL AIRBENDER.
05:25	YOU MUST BE THE AVATAR.
05:28	THAT'S AMAZING! I'VE HEARD STORIES ABOUT YOU.
05:31	THANKS.
05:33	WOW! THIS GLIDER CHAIR
05:34	IS INCREDIBLE.
05:36	IF YOU THINK THIS IS GOOD, WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE
05:38	THE OTHER STUFF MY DAD DESIGNED.
06:01	WOW!
06:02	YEAH, MY DAD IS THE MASTERMIND
06:05	BEHIND THIS WHOLE PLACE.
06:07	EVERYTHING IS POWERED BY HOT AIR.
06:08	IT EVEN PUMPS HOT AIR CURRENTS OUTSIDE
06:10	TO GIVE US A LIFT WHEN WE'RE GLIDING.
06:12	THIS PLACE IS UNBELIEVABLE.
06:13	YEAH. IT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT?
06:15	Aang: NO. JUST UNBELIEVABLE.
06:17	AANG USED TO COME HERE A LONG TIME AGO.
06:20	I THINK HE'S A LITTLE SHOCKED IT'S SO DIFFERENT.
06:23	SO BETTER!
06:30	Aang: THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE HISTORY OF MY PEOPLE.
06:46	UGH!
06:48	I'M SURE SOME PARTS OF THE TEMPLE ARE STILL THE SAME.
06:55	Aang: IT'S NICE TO SEE AT LEAST ONE PART OF THE TEMPLE
06:58	THAT ISN'T RUINED.
07:01	[MAN YELLS]
07:03	[ALL COUGHING]
07:10	WHAT THE DOODLE?! DON'T YOU KNOW ENOUGH
07:12	TO STAY AWAY FROM CONSTRUCTION SITES?
07:14	WE HAVE TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE BATHHOUSE.
07:17	DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID?
07:18	YOU JUST DESTROYED SOMETHING SACRED
07:20	FOR A STUPID BATHHOUSE.
07:22	WELL, PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE STARTING TO STINK.
07:25	THIS WHOLE PLACE STINKS.
07:27	HYAH!
07:36	THIS IS A SACRED TEMPLE. YOU CAN'T TREAT IT THIS WAY.
07:40	I'VE SEEN IT WHEN THE MONKS WERE HERE.
07:41	I KNOW WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE.
07:43	THE MONKS? BUT YOU'RE 12.
07:46	DAD, HE'S THE AVATAR.
07:49	HE USED TO COME HERE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.
07:51	WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHO SAID YOU COULD BE HERE?
07:54	DOING HERE...
07:56	A LONG TIME AGO, BUT NOT A HUNDRED YEARS,
08:00	MY PEOPLE BECAME REFUGEES
08:02	AFTER A TERRIBLE FLOOD.
08:04	MY INFANT SON, TEO, WAS BADLY HURT
08:07	AND LOST HIS MOTHER.
08:09	[SNIFFLES]
08:10	I NEEDED SOMEWHERE TO REBUILD,
08:13	AND I STUMBLED ACROSS THIS PLACE.
08:14	COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
08:16	EVERYWHERE PICTURES OF FLYING PEOPLE, BUT EMPTY.
08:19	NOBODY HOME.
08:21	THEN I CAME ACROSS THESE FAN-LIKE CONTRAPTIONS.
08:24	OUR GLIDERS.
08:26	YES, LITTLE LIGHT FLYING MACHINES.
08:28	THEY GAVE ME AN IDEA--
08:30	BUILD A NEW LIFE FOR MY SON IN THE AIR.
08:33	THEN EVERYONE WOULD BE ON EQUAL GROUND,
08:36	SO TO SPEAK.
08:38	WE'RE JUST IN THE PROCESS OF IMPROVING UPON WHAT'S ALREADY HERE.
08:42	AND AFTER ALL, ISN'T THAT WHAT NATURE DOES?
08:45	Aang: NATURE KNOWS WHERE TO STOP.
08:47	I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE.
08:50	UNFORTUNATELY, PROGRESS HAS A WAY OF GETTING AWAY FROM US.
08:55	LOOK AT THE TIME!
08:58	COME. THE PULLEY SYSTEM MUST BE OILED BEFORE DARK.
09:02	WAIT. HOW CAN YOU TELL THE TIME FROM THAT THING?
09:04	THE NOTCHES ALL LOOK THE SAME.
09:06	THE CANDLE WILL TELL US. WATCH.
09:10	YOU PUT SPARK POWDER IN THE CANDLE!
09:13	4 FLASHES. SO IT'S EXACTLY 4 HOURS PAST MIDDAY,
09:16	OR AS I CALL IT, 4 O'CANDLE.
09:19	HA HA!
09:20	IF YOU LIKED THAT,
09:22	WAIT TILL YOU SEE MY FINGER-SAFE KNIFE SHARPENER.
09:24	IT ONLY TOOK ME 3 TRIES TO GET IT RIGHT.
09:27	AAH!
09:30	Dad: FOLLOW ME.
09:31	HEY, AANG, I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
09:34	Aang: I JUST CAN'T GET OVER IT.
09:36	THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING THAT'S THE SAME.
09:38	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
09:40	THE TEMPLE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT,
09:41	BUT THE CREATURES THAT LIVE HERE ARE
09:43	PROBABLY DIRECT DESCENDENTS
09:45	OF THE ONES THAT LIVED HERE A LONG TIME AGO.
09:47	YOU'RE RIGHT. THEY'RE KIND OF KEEPERS OF THE TEMPLE'S ORIGINS.
09:50	BESIDES, THERE IS ONE PART OF THE TEMPLE
09:53	THAT HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL.
09:55	Katara: HEY...
09:57	IT'S JUST LIKE THE ONE IN THE OTHER AIR TEMPLE.
09:59	ONLY AN AIRBENDER CAN OPEN IT.
10:01	SO INSIDE, IT'S COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED.
10:03	JUST THE WAY THE MONKS LEFT IT.
10:05	I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THERE.
10:07	AANG?
10:09	I'M SORRY. THIS IS THE LAST PART OF THE TEMPLE
10:11	THAT'S THE SAME AS IT WAS.
10:13	I WANT IT TO STAY THAT WAY.
10:15	I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.
10:16	I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW IT WAS HERE.
10:19	THANKS.
10:26	THESE LANTERNS ARE TERRIBLE. I CAN'T SEE.
10:30	WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO USE FIREFLIES FOR LIGHT?
10:32	HEY! CLOSE THAT UP. THEY'LL GET LOOSE.
10:35	FIREFLIES ARE A NONFLAMMABLE LIGHT SOURCE.
10:45	COVER YOUR NOSE AND HOLD YOUR BREATH.
10:48	OK. SO YOU BROUGHT ME ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE
10:51	TO SEE AN EMPTY ROOM.
10:53	WRONG.
10:54	IT'S FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH NATURAL GAS.
10:57	I CAME ACROSS IT MY FIRST TIME HERE.
11:00	UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS CARRYING A TORCH AT THE TIME.
11:03	NEARLY BLEW MYSELF AND THE WHOLE PLACE EVEN MORE SKY-HIGH.
11:06	I THOUGHT MY EYEBROWS WOULD NEVER GROW BACK.
11:09	ANYWAY, THERE'S A VITAL PROBLEM THAT NEEDS SOLVING.
11:13	FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE GAS LEAKS.
11:16	AND THEY'RE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.
11:19	SO THIS PLACE IS AN EXPLOSION WAITING TO HAPPEN.
11:21	YES. UNTIL I FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOCATE
11:25	SOMETHING I CAN'T SEE, HEAR, SMELL, OR TOUCH.
11:29	Teo: THE WIND WILL CARRY YOU.
11:30	IT SUPPORTS SOMETHING INSIDE YOU,
11:32	SOMETHING EVEN LIGHTER THAN AIR.
11:34	AND THAT SOMETHING TAKES OVER WHEN YOU FLY.
11:38	I'VE CHANGED MY MIND. I THINK I WAS BORN WITHOUT THAT SOMETHING.
11:41	HA HA! IMPOSSIBLE. EVERYBODY HAS IT.
11:44	Aang: SPIRIT.
11:45	WHAT?
11:47	THAT'S THE SOMETHING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
11:49	YEAH. I SUPPOSE IT IS.
11:52	ARE YOU READY?
11:53	NO! AAH!
11:57	[LAUGHING]
12:04	I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M FLYING!
12:06	JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH CLOSED
12:08	SO YOU DON'T SWALLOW A BUG.
12:11	TEO WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE AIR.
12:13	ALL I HAD TO DO WAS TRUST IT,
12:15	LET IT CARRY ME.
12:17	EVEN THOUGH TEO'S NOT AN AIRBENDER,
12:19	HE REALLY DOES HAVE THE SPIRIT OF ONE.
12:24	I'VE BEEN THINKING.
12:26	IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT'S IN THAT ROOM,
12:28	I'D BE HAPPY TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR YOU.
12:30	GREAT.
12:30	Katara: WAIT!
12:32	HOW DO I LAND THIS THING?
12:34	WHAT IF I LAND OVER IN THE--
12:35	[GAGS]
12:37	BLECH! BUG. BUG.
12:39	THAT WAS A BUG.
12:44	[CRASH]
12:46	I SAID, DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.
12:48	OH!
12:50	OH, DON'T WORRY.
12:51	THAT EXPERIMENT IS OLD,
12:52	AND THAT EGG WAS JUST PART OF LAST WEEK'S LUNCH.
12:56	[SNIFFS] UGH!
12:57	WEEK-OLD EGG SMELL.
12:59	QUICK, FIND THAT EGG.
13:02	I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M FINALLY GOING TO SEE WHAT'S INSIDE.
13:18	HOW COULD SOMETHING THAT'S SO SMALL, YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE IT,
13:21	MAKE SUCH A BIG STINK?
13:22	THAT'S THE SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEM.
13:25	YEAH. IF WE PUT A WHOLE MESS OF ROTTEN EGGS
13:28	IN THE CELLAR WHERE THE GAS SEEPS UP...
13:30	THE GAS WILL MIX WITH THE SMELL OF ROTTEN EGGS.
13:34	THEN IF THERE'S A LEAK...
13:35	YOU SMELL ROTTEN EGGS.
13:37	THEN YOU JUST FOLLOW YOUR NOSE
13:39	TO THE PLACE WHERE THE SMELL IS COMING FROM...
13:41	AND PLUG UP THE HOLE WHERE THE GAS IS ESCAPING.
13:44	YOU'RE A GENIUS!
13:44	YOU'RE A GENIUS!
13:45	[BELL RINGING]
13:47	SOMETHING IS WRONG. I'VE GOT TO GO.
14:02	THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
14:05	YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
14:07	YOU'RE MAKING WEAPONS FOR THE FIRE NATION.
14:17	YOU MAKE WEAPONS FOR THE FIRE NATION?
14:22	EXPLAIN ALL THIS...NOW!
14:24	IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AFTER WE MOVED HERE.
14:27	FIRE NATION SOLDIERS FOUND OUR SETTLEMENT.
14:30	YOU WERE TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THIS TALE.
14:33	THEY WERE GOING TO DESTROY EVERYTHING,
14:35	BURN IT TO THE GROUND.
14:37	I PLEADED WITH THEM. I BEGGED THEM TO SPARE US.
14:40	THEY ASKED WHAT I HAD TO OFFER.
14:42	I OFFERED MY SERVICES.
14:45	YOU MUST UNDERSTAND. I DID THIS FOR YOU.
14:57	[DOOR OPENS]
14:59	WHEN ARE THEY COMING?
15:01	SOON, VERY SOON.
15:04	YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM MORE WEAPONS.
15:06	IF I DON'T GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT,
15:08	THEY WILL DESTROY THIS PLACE.
15:12	HOW CAN I BE PROUD OF YOU
15:14	WHEN YOUR INVENTIONS ARE BEING USED FOR MURDER?
15:17	I NEED SOME TIME TO THINK.
15:19	[BELL RINGING]
15:20	YOU NEED TO LEAVE. GO.
15:22	WE'RE NOT LEAVING.
15:23	THEN HIDE QUICKLY.
15:29	YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO KEEP ME WAITING.
15:31	GIVE ME WHAT YOU OWE US SO I CAN BE ON MY WAY.
15:35	WELL? IS THERE A PROBLEM?
15:39	NO. RIGHT THIS WAY.
15:44	THE DEAL IS OFF.
15:45	THE AVATAR.
15:47	AANG, DON'T GET INVOLVED.
15:49	IF I DON'T GET WHAT I CAME FOR,
15:51	THE FIRE NATION WILL BURN THIS PLACE TO RUBBLE.
15:54	GET OUT OF HERE.
15:55	UH!
15:57	YOU'RE LEAVING EMPTY-HANDED.
15:59	THEN THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS TEMPLE WILL BE ON YOUR HEAD.
16:12	THIS IS BAD, VERY BAD.
16:14	AANG, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
16:16	HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY KEEP THEM ALL AWAY?
16:18	I'LL TELL YOU HOW.
16:19	WE HAVE SOMETHING THEY DON'T--
16:21	AIR POWER.
16:22	WE CONTROL THE SKY.
16:24	THAT'S SOMETHING THE FIRE NATION CAN'T DO.
16:26	WE CAN WIN.
16:28	Dad: I WANT TO HELP.
16:31	GOOD. WE'LL NEED IT.
16:34	WE FINALLY GOT THE WAR BALLOON WORKING,
16:36	THANKS TO SOKKA.
16:38	THIS BOY IS A GENIUS.
16:40	THANK YOU. YOU'RE A GENIUS.
16:41	THANK YOU.
16:43	SEE, THE PROBLEM WITH THE OLD WAR BALLOON
16:45	WAS, YOU COULD GET IT AIRBORNE,
16:47	BUT ONCE YOU DID, IT JUST KEPT GOING.
16:49	YOU COULD PUT A HOLE IN THE TOP,
16:51	BUT THEN ALL THE HOT AIR WOULD ESCAPE.
16:53	SO THE QUESTION BECAME, HOW DO YOU KEEP A LID ON HOT AIR?
16:56	UGH. IF ONLY WE KNEW.
16:58	[LAUGHTER]
17:00	A LID IS ACTUALLY THE ANSWER.
17:03	IF YOU CONTROL THE HOT AIR, YOU CONTROL THE WAR BALLOON.
17:06	HMM, THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SMART.
17:09	OK. WE GOT 4 KINDS OF BOMBS--
17:11	SMOKE, SLIME, FIRE, AND...
17:13	STINK.
17:15	NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF STINK.
17:23	THEY'RE COMING!
17:25	ARE WE READY?
17:27	YES, BUT WHERE'S SOKKA WITH THE WAR BALLOON?
17:29	WE'LL HAVE TO START WITHOUT IT.
17:42	[CHEERING]
18:03	UHH!
18:03	UH!
18:03	OOH!
18:14	TAKE THEM OUT OF THE SKY NOW!
18:17	[ALL COUGHING]
18:39	WE'VE GOT THEM ON THE RUN.
18:40	WE NEED MORE SLIME.
18:48	AAH!
19:14	HUH!
19:16	UHH...UH!
19:21	WHOA!
19:59	UH! HUH!
20:01	UH! HUH! YAAH!
20:16	THOSE THINGS ARE UNSTOPPABLE.
20:18	I THINK I KNOW HOW THEY WORK.
20:20	I REMEMBER MY DAD TINKERING WITH A COUNTERBALANCING SYSTEM,
20:22	SOMETHING TO DO WITH WATER.
20:24	WORKS GREAT, HUH?
20:26	WATER? CAN YOU GET ME CLOSE TO ONE?
20:28	NO PROBLEM.
20:55	HUH!
20:57	HUH!
21:01	[ROAR]
21:10	WE'RE OUT OF BOMBS.
21:12	COME ON, SOKKA. WHERE'S THAT WAR BALLOON?
21:24	HEY, WHY AREN'T THEY SHOOTING AT US?
21:27	THE INSIGNIA.
21:29	THEY THINK WE'RE ON THEIR SIDE.
21:30	THEN I GUESS THEY WON'T SEE THIS COMING.
21:32	BOMBS AWAY.
21:36	UH!
21:36	HEY!
21:36	AAH!
21:42	OH, NO. THAT WAS THE LAST ONE.
21:46	WAIT A SECOND. [SNIFFS]
21:47	YOU SMELL THAT?
21:48	ROTTEN EGGS. THERE.
21:50	THAT'S WHERE THE GAS IS ESCAPING.
21:57	WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S OUR FUEL SOURCE.
22:01	IT'S THE ONLY BOMB WE'VE GOT.
22:24	Aang: LOOK. THEY'RE RETREATING.
22:26	YEAH!
22:28	Sokka: WE'RE GOING DOWN!
22:29	NO!
22:29	SOKKA, HOLD ON!
22:32	GET READY.
22:39	OHHHH!
22:48	Aang: YOU KNOW WHAT?
22:50	I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS ALL LIVE HERE NOW.
22:52	I REALIZED IT'S LIKE THE HERMIT CRAB.
22:55	MAYBE YOU WEREN'T BORN HERE,
22:57	BUT YOU FOUND THIS EMPTY SHELL AND MADE IT YOUR HOME,
23:00	AND NOW YOU PROTECT EACH OTHER.
23:02	THAT MEANS A LOT COMING FROM YOU.
23:04	AANG, YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT AIR POWER.
23:07	AS LONG AS WE'VE GOT THE SKIES,
23:09	WE'LL HAVE THE FIRE NATION ON THE RUN.
23:11	[CHEERING]
23:26	THIS DEFEAT IS THE GATEWAY TO MANY VICTORIES.
23:43	[MEN CHANTING RHYTHMICALLY]
