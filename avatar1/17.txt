00:09	katara: water...
00:10	earth...
00:12	fire...
00:14	air.
00:16	long ago, the 4 nations lived together in harmony.
00:20	then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
00:25	only the avatar, master of all 4 elements,
00:28	could stop them.
00:29	but when the world needed him most,
00:31	he vanished.
00:32	100 years passed,
00:34	and my brother and i discovered the new avatar--
00:36	an airbender named aang.
00:38	and although his airbending skills are great,
00:40	he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
00:43	aang: oof.
00:45	but i believe aang can save the world.
00:56	aang: there it is--
00:58	the southern air temple.
01:00	this place used to be full of monks
01:02	and lemurs and bison.
01:04	i can't believe how much things have changed.
01:07	[grunting]
01:09	i don't suppose you have a key?
01:11	the key, sokka, is airbending.
01:16	and if firebenders found this temple,
01:18	that means they found the other ones, too.
01:20	i really am the last airbender.
01:30	man: so, travelers, the next time you think you hear
01:34	a strange large bird talking,
01:37	take a closer look. it might not be a giant parrot, but a flying man,
01:44	a member of a secret group of airwalkers who laugh at gravity
01:49	and laugh at those bound to the earth by it.
01:52	[momo cooing]
01:54	aang: aren't airbender stories the best?
01:56	katara: was it realistic? is that how it was back then?
01:59	i laugh at gravity all the time.
02:01	ha ha! gravity.
02:03	jingle, jingle.
02:09	sorry.
02:11	aw. cheapskates.
02:12	hey, thanks for the story.
02:15	tell it to the cap, boy.
02:21	aw. much obliged, little bat thing.
02:24	it means a lot to hear airbender stories.
02:26	it must have been a hundred years ago
02:28	your great-grandpa met them.
02:30	what are you prattling about, child?
02:32	great-grandpappy saw the airwalkers last week.
02:34	[great-grandpa speaks hoarsely]
02:43	aang: we're almost to the northern air temple.
02:45	this is where they had the championships
02:47	for sky bison polo.
02:49	do you think we'll really find airbenders?
02:52	you want me to be like you or totally honest?
02:55	are you saying i'm a liar?
02:57	i'm saying you're an optimist. same thing, basically.
02:59	hey, guys, look at this!
03:10	they really are airbenders!
03:13	no, they're not.
03:15	what do you mean, they're not?
03:16	those guys are flying!
03:18	gliding maybe, but not flying.
03:19	you can tell by the way they move
03:21	they're not airbending. those people have no spirit.
03:27	oh!
03:27	oh!
03:28	[boy chuckling]
03:31	i don't know, aang. that kid seemed pretty spirited.
03:44	ow!
03:46	we'd better find some solid ground
03:47	before it finds us.
03:52	ha ha!
03:57	go, teo!
03:59	show that bald kid how it's done!
04:17	hey there. you're pretty good.
04:19	yeah, i know. but i can do more than fancy gliding.
04:38	wow! i don't think i can do that.
04:40	but here's a good one.
05:00	[kids cheering]
05:03	what do you think?
05:05	[deadpan] it's great.
05:22	hey, you're a real airbender.
05:25	you must be the avatar.
05:28	that's amazing! i've heard stories about you.
05:31	thanks.
05:33	wow! this glider chair
05:34	is incredible.
05:36	if you think this is good, wait until you see
05:38	the other stuff my dad designed.
06:01	wow!
06:02	yeah, my dad is the mastermind
06:05	behind this whole place.
06:07	everything is powered by hot air.
06:08	it even pumps hot air currents outside
06:10	to give us a lift when we're gliding.
06:12	this place is unbelievable.
06:13	yeah. it's great, isn't it?
06:15	aang: no. just unbelievable.
06:17	aang used to come here a long time ago.
06:20	i think he's a little shocked it's so different.
06:23	so better!
06:30	aang: this is supposed to be the history of my people.
06:46	ugh!
06:48	i'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.
06:55	aang: it's nice to see at least one part of the temple
06:58	that isn't ruined.
07:01	[man yells]
07:03	[all coughing]
07:10	what the doodle?! don't you know enough
07:12	to stay away from construction sites?
07:14	we have to make room for the bathhouse.
07:17	do you know what you did?
07:18	you just destroyed something sacred
07:20	for a stupid bathhouse.
07:22	well, people around here are starting to stink.
07:25	this whole place stinks.
07:27	hyah!
07:36	this is a sacred temple. you can't treat it this way.
07:40	i've seen it when the monks were here.
07:41	i know what it's supposed to be like.
07:43	the monks? but you're 12.
07:46	dad, he's the avatar.
07:49	he used to come here a hundred years ago.
07:51	what are you doing? who said you could be here?
07:54	doing here...
07:56	a long time ago, but not a hundred years,
08:00	my people became refugees
08:02	after a terrible flood.
08:04	my infant son, teo, was badly hurt
08:07	and lost his mother.
08:09	[sniffles]
08:10	i needed somewhere to rebuild,
08:13	and i stumbled across this place.
08:14	couldn't believe it.
08:16	everywhere pictures of flying people, but empty.
08:19	nobody home.
08:21	then i came across these fan-like contraptions.
08:24	our gliders.
08:26	yes, little light flying machines.
08:28	they gave me an idea--
08:30	build a new life for my son in the air.
08:33	then everyone would be on equal ground,
08:36	so to speak.
08:38	we're just in the process of improving upon what's already here.
08:42	and after all, isn't that what nature does?
08:45	aang: nature knows where to stop.
08:47	i suppose that's true.
08:50	unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us.
08:55	look at the time!
08:58	come. the pulley system must be oiled before dark.
09:02	wait. how can you tell the time from that thing?
09:04	the notches all look the same.
09:06	the candle will tell us. watch.
09:10	you put spark powder in the candle!
09:13	4 flashes. so it's exactly 4 hours past midday,
09:16	or as i call it, 4 o'candle.
09:19	ha ha!
09:20	if you liked that,
09:22	wait till you see my finger-safe knife sharpener.
09:24	it only took me 3 tries to get it right.
09:27	aah!
09:30	dad: follow me.
09:31	hey, aang, i want to show you something.
09:34	aang: i just can't get over it.
09:36	there's not a single thing that's the same.
09:38	i don't know about that.
09:40	the temple might be different,
09:41	but the creatures that live here are
09:43	probably direct descendents
09:45	of the ones that lived here a long time ago.
09:47	you're right. they're kind of keepers of the temple's origins.
09:50	besides, there is one part of the temple
09:53	that hasn't changed at all.
09:55	katara: hey...
09:57	it's just like the one in the other air temple.
09:59	only an airbender can open it.
10:01	so inside, it's completely untouched.
10:03	just the way the monks left it.
10:05	i've always wondered what it was like in there.
10:07	aang?
10:09	i'm sorry. this is the last part of the temple
10:11	that's the same as it was.
10:13	i want it to stay that way.
10:15	i completely understand.
10:16	i just wanted you to know it was here.
10:19	thanks.
10:26	these lanterns are terrible. i can't see.
10:30	why would you want to use fireflies for light?
10:32	hey! close that up. they'll get loose.
10:35	fireflies are a nonflammable light source.
10:45	cover your nose and hold your breath.
10:48	ok. so you brought me all the way down here
10:51	to see an empty room.
10:53	wrong.
10:54	it's filled to the brim with natural gas.
10:57	i came across it my first time here.
11:00	unfortunately, i was carrying a torch at the time.
11:03	nearly blew myself and the whole place even more sky-high.
11:06	i thought my eyebrows would never grow back.
11:09	anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving.
11:13	from time to time, we have gas leaks.
11:16	and they're nearly impossible to find.
11:19	so this place is an explosion waiting to happen.
11:21	yes. until i figure out how to locate
11:25	something i can't see, hear, smell, or touch.
11:29	teo: the wind will carry you.
11:30	it supports something inside you,
11:32	something even lighter than air.
11:34	and that something takes over when you fly.
11:38	i've changed my mind. i think i was born without that something.
11:41	ha ha! impossible. everybody has it.
11:44	aang: spirit.
11:45	what?
11:47	that's the something you're talking about.
11:49	yeah. i suppose it is.
11:52	are you ready?
11:53	no! aah!
11:57	[laughing]
12:04	i can't believe i'm flying!
12:06	just make sure you keep your mouth closed
12:08	so you don't swallow a bug.
12:11	teo was right about the air.
12:13	all i had to do was trust it,
12:15	let it carry me.
12:17	even though teo's not an airbender,
12:19	he really does have the spirit of one.
12:24	i've been thinking.
12:26	if you want to see what's in that room,
12:28	i'd be happy to open the door for you.
12:30	great.
12:30	katara: wait!
12:32	how do i land this thing?
12:34	what if i land over in the--
12:35	[gags]
12:37	blech! bug. bug.
12:39	that was a bug.
12:44	[crash]
12:46	i said, don't touch anything.
12:48	oh!
12:50	oh, don't worry.
12:51	that experiment is old,
12:52	and that egg was just part of last week's lunch.
12:56	[sniffs] ugh!
12:57	week-old egg smell.
12:59	quick, find that egg.
13:02	i can't believe i'm finally going to see what's inside.
13:18	how could something that's so small, you can't even see it,
13:21	make such a big stink?
13:22	that's the solution to our problem.
13:25	yeah. if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs
13:28	in the cellar where the gas seeps up...
13:30	the gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs.
13:34	then if there's a leak...
13:35	you smell rotten eggs.
13:37	then you just follow your nose
13:39	to the place where the smell is coming from...
13:41	and plug up the hole where the gas is escaping.
13:44	you're a genius!
13:44	you're a genius!
13:45	[bell ringing]
13:47	something is wrong. i've got to go.
14:02	this is a nightmare.
14:05	you don't understand.
14:07	you're making weapons for the fire nation.
14:17	you make weapons for the fire nation?
14:22	explain all this...now!
14:24	it was about a year after we moved here.
14:27	fire nation soldiers found our settlement.
14:30	you were too young to remember this tale.
14:33	they were going to destroy everything,
14:35	burn it to the ground.
14:37	i pleaded with them. i begged them to spare us.
14:40	they asked what i had to offer.
14:42	i offered my services.
14:45	you must understand. i did this for you.
14:57	[door opens]
14:59	when are they coming?
15:01	soon, very soon.
15:04	you can't give them more weapons.
15:06	if i don't give them what they want,
15:08	they will destroy this place.
15:12	how can i be proud of you
15:14	when your inventions are being used for murder?
15:17	i need some time to think.
15:19	[bell ringing]
15:20	you need to leave. go.
15:22	we're not leaving.
15:23	then hide quickly.
15:29	you know better than to keep me waiting.
15:31	give me what you owe us so i can be on my way.
15:35	well? is there a problem?
15:39	no. right this way.
15:44	the deal is off.
15:45	the avatar.
15:47	aang, don't get involved.
15:49	if i don't get what i came for,
15:51	the fire nation will burn this place to rubble.
15:54	get out of here.
15:55	uh!
15:57	you're leaving empty-handed.
15:59	then the destruction of this temple will be on your head.
16:12	this is bad, very bad.
16:14	aang, what are we gonna do?
16:16	how can we possibly keep them all away?
16:18	i'll tell you how.
16:19	we have something they don't--
16:21	air power.
16:22	we control the sky.
16:24	that's something the fire nation can't do.
16:26	we can win.
16:28	dad: i want to help.
16:31	good. we'll need it.
16:34	we finally got the war balloon working,
16:36	thanks to sokka.
16:38	this boy is a genius.
16:40	thank you. you're a genius.
16:41	thank you.
16:43	see, the problem with the old war balloon
16:45	was, you could get it airborne,
16:47	but once you did, it just kept going.
16:49	you could put a hole in the top,
16:51	but then all the hot air would escape.
16:53	so the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?
16:56	ugh. if only we knew.
16:58	[laughter]
17:00	a lid is actually the answer.
17:03	if you control the hot air, you control the war balloon.
17:06	hmm, that's actually pretty smart.
17:09	ok. we got 4 kinds of bombs--
17:11	smoke, slime, fire, and...
17:13	stink.
17:15	never underestimate the power of stink.
17:23	they're coming!
17:25	are we ready?
17:27	yes, but where's sokka with the war balloon?
17:29	we'll have to start without it.
17:42	[cheering]
18:03	uhh!
18:03	uh!
18:03	ooh!
18:14	take them out of the sky now!
18:17	[all coughing]
18:39	we've got them on the run.
18:40	we need more slime.
18:48	aah!
19:14	huh!
19:16	uhh...uh!
19:21	whoa!
19:59	uh! huh!
20:01	uh! huh! yaah!
20:16	those things are unstoppable.
20:18	i think i know how they work.
20:20	i remember my dad tinkering with a counterbalancing system,
20:22	something to do with water.
20:24	works great, huh?
20:26	water? can you get me close to one?
20:28	no problem.
20:55	huh!
20:57	huh!
21:01	[roar]
21:10	we're out of bombs.
21:12	come on, sokka. where's that war balloon?
21:24	hey, why aren't they shooting at us?
21:27	the insignia.
21:29	they think we're on their side.
21:30	then i guess they won't see this coming.
21:32	bombs away.
21:36	uh!
21:36	hey!
21:36	aah!
21:42	oh, no. that was the last one.
21:46	wait a second. [sniffs]
21:47	you smell that?
21:48	rotten eggs. there.
21:50	that's where the gas is escaping.
21:57	what are you doing? that's our fuel source.
22:01	it's the only bomb we've got.
22:24	aang: look. they're retreating.
22:26	yeah!
22:28	sokka: we're going down!
22:29	no!
22:29	sokka, hold on!
22:32	get ready.
22:39	ohhhh!
22:48	aang: you know what?
22:50	i'm really glad you guys all live here now.
22:52	i realized it's like the hermit crab.
22:55	maybe you weren't born here,
22:57	but you found this empty shell and made it your home,
23:00	and now you protect each other.
23:02	that means a lot coming from you.
23:04	aang, you were right about air power.
23:07	as long as we've got the skies,
23:09	we'll have the fire nation on the run.
23:11	[cheering]
23:26	this defeat is the gateway to many victories.
23:43	[men chanting rhythmically]
